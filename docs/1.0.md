# RSS Namespace Extension for Podcasting (Tag Specification)
A wholistic RSS namespace for podcasting that is meant to synthesize the fragmented world of podcast namespaces. As 
elements are canonized, they will be added to this document so developers can begin implementation. The 
specifications below are considered locked and the team will prioritize backward compatibility. We are operating 
under the [Rules for Standards-Makers](http://scripting.com/2017/05/09/rulesForStandardsmakers.html).

The namespace for this extension is `https://podcastindex.org/namespace/1.0`. Clients which recognize this namespace 
must also recognize `https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/docs/1.0.md` as identical. The 
suggested tag prefix for use in XML is `podcast`, but clients should support alternate prefixes for this namespace. 
If your application generates RSS feeds and you implement one or more elements below, you will need to link this 
document in your XML:

```xml
<rss version="2.0" xmlns:podcast="https://podcastindex.org/namespace/1.0">
```

# Podcast Tags
Each tag below exists in the podcast namespace within the specified parent. All attributes are required unless 
explicitly specified as optional. Anywhere the url of a hyper-text based resource is specified, it must be given as 
`https:` and not `http:`.


<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Transcript
`<podcast:transcript>`<br><br>
This tag is used to link to a transcript or closed captions file. Multiple tags can be present for multiple 
transcript formats.

Detailed file format information and example files are [here](../transcripts/transcripts.md).

### Parent
&nbsp; `<item>`

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Attributes
 - **url (required):** URL of the podcast transcript.

 - **type (required):** Mime type of the file such as `text/plain`, `text/html`, `text/vtt`, `application/json`, 
   `application/x-subrip`

 - **language (optional):** The language of the linked transcript. If there is no language attribute given, the 
   linked file is assumed to be the same language that is specified by the RSS `<language>` element.

 - **rel (optional):** If the rel="captions" attribute is present, the linked file is considered to be a closed 
   captions file, regardless of what the mime type is.  In that scenario, time codes are assumed to be present in 
   the file in some capacity.


### Examples
```xml
<podcast:transcript url="https://example.com/episode1/transcript.html" type="text/html" />
```

```xml
<podcast:transcript url="https://example.com/episode1/transcript.vtt" type="text/vtt" />
```

```xml
<podcast:transcript 
        url="https://example.com/episode1/transcript.json" 
        type="application/json" 
        language="es" 
        rel="captions" 
/>
```

```xml
<podcast:transcript url="https://example.com/episode1/transcript.srt" type="application/x-subrip" rel="captions" />
```




<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Locked
`<podcast:locked>`<br><br>
This tag may be set to `yes` or `no`. The purpose is to tell other podcast hosting platforms whether they are 
allowed to import this feed. A value of `yes` means that any attempt to import this feed into a new platform should 
be rejected.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<channel>`

### Count
&nbsp; Single

### Node value
&nbsp; The node value must be "yes" or "no".

### Attributes
 - **owner (optional):** The owner attribute is an email address that can be used to verify ownership of this feed 
   during move and import operations. This could be a public email or a virtual email address at the hosting 
   provider that redirects to the owner's true email address.

### Examples
```xml
<podcast:locked>yes</podcast:locked>
```

```xml
<podcast:locked owner="email@example.com">no</podcast:locked>
```



<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Funding
`<podcast:funding>`<br><br>
This tag lists possible donation/funding links for the podcast. The content of the tag is the recommended string to 
be used with the link.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<channel>`, `<item>` or `<podcast:liveItem>`

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Node value
&nbsp; This is a free form string supplied by the creator which they expect to be displayed in the app next to the 
link.  Please do not exceed `128 characters` for the node value or it may be truncated by aggregators.

### Attributes
 - **url (required):** The URL to be followed to fund the podcast.

### Examples
```xml
<podcast:funding url="https://www.example.com/donations">Support the show!</podcast:funding>
```

```xml
<podcast:funding url="https://www.example.com/members">Become a member!</podcast:funding>
```



<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Chapters
`<podcast:chapters>`<br><br>
Links to an external file (see example file) containing chapter data for the episode. See the [jsonChapters.md](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/chapters/jsonChapters.md) file for a description of
the chapter file syntax. And, see the [example.json](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/chapters/example.json) example file for a real world example.

Benefits with this approach are that chapters do not require altering audio files, and the chapters can be edited 
after publishing, since they are a separate file that can be requested on playback (or cached with download). JSON 
chapter information also allows chapters to be displayed by a wider range of playback tools, including web browsers 
(which typically have no access to ID3 tags), thus greatly simplifying chapter support; and images can be retrieved 
on playback, rather than bloating the filesize of the audio. The data held is compatible with normal ID3 tags, thus 
requiring no additional work for the publisher.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<item>`

### Count
&nbsp; Single

### Attributes
 - **url (required):** The URL where the chapters file is located.
 - **type (required):** Mime type of file - JSON prefered, 'application/json+chapters'.

### Examples
```xml
<podcast:chapters url="https://example.com/episode1/chapters.json" type="application/json+chapters" />
```



<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Soundbite
`<podcast:soundbite>`<br><br>
Points to one or more soundbites within a podcast episode. The intended use includes episodes previews, 
discoverability, audiogram generation, episode highlights, etc. It should be assumed that the audio/video source of 
the soundbite is the audio/video given in the item's [`<enclosure>`](https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt) element.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<item>`

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Node value
&nbsp; This is a free form string from the podcast creator to specify a title for the soundbite.  If the podcaster 
does not provide a value for the soundbite title, then leave the value blank, and podcast apps can decide to use the 
episode title or some other placeholder value in its place.  Please do not exceed `128 characters` for the node 
value or it may be truncated by aggregators.

### Attributes
 - **startTime (required):** The time where the soundbite begins
 - **duration (required):** How long is the soundbite (recommended between 15 and 120 seconds)

### Examples
```xml
<podcast:soundbite startTime="73.0" duration="60.0" />
```

```xml
<podcast:soundbite startTime="1234.5" duration="42.25">Why the Podcast Namespace Matters</podcast:soundbite>
```



<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Person
`<podcast:person>`<br><br>
This element specifies a person of interest to the podcast.  It is primarily intended to identify people like hosts, 
co-hosts and guests.  Although, it is flexible enough to allow fuller credits to be given using the roles and groups 
that are listed in the [Podcast Taxonomy Project](https://podcasttaxonomy.com/)

### Parent
&nbsp; `<channel>` (for a podcast) or `<item>` (for an individual episode)

It is suggested that `<channel>` is always populated, and `<item>` is populated where needed for an individual 
episode. Where present, people information in `<item>` wholly replaces all information from the `<channel>`.

Publishers are expected to use the `podcast:person` element in the `<channel>` parent to set the _regular_ people 
involved in the podcast: the detail that would be expected to be seen in an overview of the show.

Publishers are expected to use the `podcast:person` in the `<item>` parent to **replace** all existing information 
for an individual episode.

#### For example: _Terry and June_

The fictional podcast _Terry and June_ is normally hosted by Terry Scott and June Whitfield. Within `<channel>`, 
Terry Scott and June Whitfield are listed as the hosts. A podcast directory, or podcast app, should show Terry Scott 
and June Whitfield as the hosts of this show.

For one episode, _Terry and June_ was hosted by Reginald Marsh and June Whitfield (Terry was away). In this case, 
the `<item>` for this episode should contain Reginald Marsh and June Whitfield as the hosts of this episode. A 
podcast app, when playing this episode, should show only Reginald Marsh and June Whitfield as the hosts of this 
episode. Because people information in `<item>` replaces all existing people information in `<channel>`, Terry Scott 
should not be visible as a host of this episode.

#### For example: _Big Daddy_

The fictional podcast _Big Daddy Interviews_ is hosted by Big Daddy, a wrestler. Within `<channel>`, Big Daddy is 
listed as the host. A podcast directory, or podcast app, should show Big Daddy as the host of this show.

For one episode, _Big Daddy Interviews_ had a guest of Sid James. In this case, the `<item>` for this episode should 
contain Sid James as a guest, **and** Big Daddy as the host of this episode. Because people information in `<item>` 
replaces all existing people information in `<channel>`, Big Daddy should be re-stated as the host of this episode.

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Node value
&nbsp; This is the full name or alias of the person. This value cannot be blank.  Please do not exceed `128 
characters` for the node value or it may be truncated by aggregators.

### Attributes
 - **role:** (optional) Used to identify what role the person serves on the show or episode. This should be a 
   reference to an official role within the Podcast Taxonomy Project list (see below). If `role` is missing then 
   "host" is assumed.
 - **group:** (optional) This should be a reference to an official group within the Podcast Taxonomy Project list. 
   If `group` is not present, then "cast" is assumed.
 - **img:** (optional) This is the url of a picture or avatar of the person.
 - **href:** (optional) The url to a relevant resource of information about the person, such as a homepage or 
   third-party profile platform. Please see the [example feed](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/example.xml) for possible choices of what to use here.

The `role` and `group` attributes are case-insensitive.  So, "Host" is the same as "host", and "Cover Art Designer" 
is the same as "cover art designer".

The full taxonomy list is [here](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/taxonomy.json) as a 
json file.

### Examples
```xml
<podcast:person 
        href="https://example.com/johnsmith/blog" 
        img="http://example.com/images/johnsmith.jpg"
>John Smith</podcast:person>
```

```xml
<podcast:person 
        role="guest" 
        href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0427852888/" 
        img="http://example.com/images/janedoe.jpg"
>Jane Doe</podcast:person>
```

```xml
<podcast:person 
        role="guest" 
        href="https://www.wikipedia/alicebrown" 
        img="http://example.com/images/alicebrown.jpg"
>Alice Brown</podcast:person>
```

```xml
<podcast:person 
        group="writing" 
        role="guest" 
        href="https://www.wikipedia/alicebrown" 
        img="http://example.com/images/alicebrown.jpg"
>Alice Brown</podcast:person>
```

```xml
<podcast:person 
        group="visuals" 
        role="Cover Art Designer" 
        href="https://example.com/artist/beckysmith"
>Becky Smith</podcast:person>
```



<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Location
`<podcast:location>`<br><br>
This tag is intended to describe the location of editorial focus for a podcast's content (i.e. "what place is this 
podcast about?").  The tag has many use cases and is one of the more complex ones.  You are **highly encouraged** to 
read the full [implementation document](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/location/location.md) before starting to code for it.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<item>` or `<channel>`

### Count
&nbsp; Single

### Node Value
&nbsp; This is a free-form string meant to be a human readable location.  It may conform to conventional location 
verbiage (i.e. "Austin, TX"), but it shouldn't be depended on to be parseable in any specific way.  This value 
cannot be blank.  Please do not exceed `128 characters` for the node value or it may be truncated by aggregators.

### Attributes
 - **geo:** (recommended) This is a latitude and longitude given in ["geo" notation](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/location/location.md#geo-recommended) (i.e. "geo:30.2672,97.7431").
 - **osm:** (recommended) The Open Street Map identifier of this place, given using the OSM notation (i.e. "R113314")

### Examples
```xml
<podcast:location geo="geo:30.2672,97.7431" osm="R113314">Austin, TX</podcast:location>
```

```xml
<podcast:location geo="geo:33.51601,-86.81455" osm="R6930627">Birmingham Civil Rights Museum</podcast:location>
```

```xml
<podcast:location geo="geo:-27.86159,153.3169" osm="W43678282">Dreamworld (Queensland)</podcast:location>
```



<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Season
`<podcast:season>`<br><br>
This element allows for identifying which episodes in a podcast are part of a particular "season", with an optional 
season name attached.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<item>`

### Count
&nbsp; Single

### Node Value
&nbsp; The node value is an integer, and represents the season "number".  It is required.

### Attributes
 - **name:** (optional) - This is the "name" of the season.  If this attribute is present, applications are free to 
   **not** show the season number to the end user, and may use it simply for chronological sorting and grouping 
   purposes.

Please do not exceed `128 characters` for the name attribute.

### Examples
```xml
<podcast:season>5</podcast:season>
```

```xml
<podcast:season name="Race for the Whitehouse 2020">3</podcast:season>
```

```xml
<podcast:season name="Egyptology: The 19th Century">1</podcast:season>
```

```xml
<podcast:season name="The Yearling - Chapter 3">3</podcast:season>
```



<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Episode
`<podcast:episode>`<br><br>
This element exists largely for compatibility with the `season` tag.  But, it also allows for a similar idea to what 
"name" functions as in that element.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<item>`

### Count
&nbsp; Single

### Node Value
&nbsp; The node value is a decimal number.  It is required.

### Attributes
 - **display:** (optional) - If this attribute is present, podcast apps and aggregators are encouraged to show its 
   value instead of the purely numerical node value.  This attribute is a string.

The episode numbers are decimal, so numbering such as `100.5` is acceptable if there was a special mini-episode 
published between two other episodes.  In that scenario, the number would help with proper chronological sorting, 
while the `display` attribute could specify an alternate special "number" (a moniker) to display for the episode in 
a podcast player app UI.

Please do not exceed `32 characters` for the display attribute.

### Examples
```xml
<podcast:episode>3</podcast:episode>
```

```xml
<podcast:episode>315.5</podcast:episode>
```

```xml
<podcast:episode display="Ch.3">204</podcast:episode>
```

```xml
<podcast:episode display="Day 5">9</podcast:episode>
```



<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Trailer
`<podcast:trailer>`<br><br>
This element is used to define the location of an audio or video file to be used as a trailer for the entire podcast 
or a specific season.  There can be more than one trailer present in the channel of the feed.  This element is 
basically just like an [`<enclosure>`](https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt) 
with the extra `pubdate` and `season` attributes added.

If there is more than one trailer tag present in the channel, the most recent one (according to its `pubdate`) 
should be chosen as the preview by default within podcast apps.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<channel>`

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Node Value
&nbsp; The node value is a string, which is the title of the trailer. It is required. Please do not exceed `128 
characters` for the node value or it may be truncated by aggregators.

### Attributes
 - **url:** (required) This is a url that points to the audio or video file to be played. This attribute is a string.
 - **pubdate:** (required) The date the trailer was published. This attribute is an RFC2822 formatted date string.
 - **length:** (recommended) The length of the file in bytes. This attribute is a number.
 - **type:** (recommended) The mime type of the file. This attribute is a string.
 - **season:** (optional) If this attribute is present it specifies that this trailer is for a particular season 
   number. This attribute is a number.

If the `season` attribute is present, it must be a number that matches the format of the `<podcast:season>` tag. So, 
for a podcast that has 3 published seasons, a new `<podcast:trailer season="4">` tag can be put in the channel to 
later be matched up with a `<podcast:season>4<podcast:season>` tag when it is published within a new `<item>`.

#### Examples
```xml
<podcast:trailer 
        pubdate="Thu, 01 Apr 2021 08:00:00 EST" 
        url="https://example.org/trailers/teaser.mp3" 
        length="12345678" 
        type="audio/mpeg
">Coming April 1st, 2021</podcast:trailer>
```

```xml
<podcast:trailer 
        pubdate="Thu, 01 Apr 2021 08:00:00 EST" 
        url="https://example.org/trailers/season4teaser.mp4" 
        length="12345678" 
        type="video/mp4" 
        season="4"
>Season 4: Race for the Whitehouse</podcast:trailer>

(later matches with)

<podcast:season name="Race for the Whitehouse">4</podcast:season>
```



<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## License
`<podcast:license>`<br><br>
This element defines a license that is applied to the audio/video content of a single episode, or the audio/video of 
the podcast as a whole.  Custom licenses must always include a url attribute.  Implementors are encouraged to read 
the license tag companion [document](/license/license.md) for a more complete picture of what this tag is intended 
to accomplish.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<channel>` or `<item>`

### Count
&nbsp; Single

### Node Value
&nbsp; The node value must be a lower-cased reference to a license "identifier" defined in the companion 
[license list](/license/licenses.json) file if the license being used is a well-known, public license.  Or, if it 
is a custom license, it must be a free form abbreviation of the name of the license as you reference it publicly. 
Please do not exceed `128 characters` for the node value or it may be truncated by aggregators.

### Attributes
 - **url:** (optional) This is a url that points to the full, legal language of the license being referenced.  This 
   attribute is optional for well-known public licenses.  For new, or custom licenses it is required.

### Examples
```xml
<podcast:license>CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0</podcast:license>
```

```xml
<podcast:license url="https://example.org/mypodcastlicense/full.pdf">my-podcast-license-v1</podcast:license>
```



<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Alternate Enclosure
`<podcast:alternateEnclosure>`<br><br>
This element is meant to provide different versions of, or companion media to the main [`<enclosure>`](https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt) file.  This could be an audio only version of a video
podcast to allow apps to switch back and forth between audio/video, lower (or higher) bitrate versions for bandwidth 
constrained areas, alternative codecs for different device platforms, alternate URI schemes and download types such 
as IPFS or WebTorrent, commentary tracks or supporting source clips, etc.

This is a complex tag, so implementors are highly encouraged to read the companion [document](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/proposal-docs/alternateEnclosure/alternateEnclosure.md) for a
fuller understanding of how this tag works and what it is capable of.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<item>`

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Node Value
&nbsp; The node value must be one or more `<podcast:source>` elements that each define a uri where the media file 
can be downloaded or streamed.  A single, optional `<podcast:integrity>` element may also be included to allow for 
file integrity checking.

### Attributes
 - **type:** (required) Mime type of the media asset.
 - **length:** (recommended) Length of the file in bytes.
 - **bitrate:** (optional) Average encoding bitrate of the media asset, expressed in bits per second.
 - **height:** (optional) Height of the media asset for video formats.
 - **lang:** (optional) An [IETF language tag (BCP 47)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCP_47) code identifying the 
   language of this media.
 - **title:** (optional) A human-readable string identifying the name of the media asset. Should be limited to 32 
   characters for UX.
 - **rel:** (optional) Provides a method of offering and/or grouping together different media elements. If not set, 
   or set to "default", the media will be grouped with the enclosure and assumed to be an alternative to the 
   enclosure's encoding/transport. This attribute can and should be the same for items with the same content encoded 
   by different means. Should be limited to 32 characters for UX.
 - **codecs:** (optional) An [RFC 6381](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6381) string specifying the codecs available 
   in this media.
 - **default:** (optional) Boolean specifying whether or not the given media is the same as the file from the 
   enclosure element and should be the preferred media element. The primary reason to set this is to offer 
   alternative transports for the enclosure. If not set, this should be assumed to be false.

### Examples
```xml
<enclosure url="https://example.com/file-0.mp3" length="43200000" type="audio/mpeg" />

<podcast:alternateEnclosure type="audio/mpeg" length="43200000" bitrate="128000" default="true" title="Standard">

<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Source
`<podcast:source>`<br><br>
This element defines a uri location for a `<podcast:alternateEnclosure>` media file.  It is meant to be used as a 
child of the `<podcast:alternateEnclosure>` element. At least one `<podcast:source>` element must be present within 
every `<podcast:alternateEnclosure>` element.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<podcast:alternateEnclosure>`

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Attributes
 - **uri:** (required) This is the uri where the media file resides.
 - **contentType:** (optional) This is a string that declares the mime-type of the file. It is useful if the 
   transport mechanism is different than the file being delivered, as is the case with a torrents.

### Examples
```xml
<podcast:alternateEnclosure type="video/mp4" length="7924786" bitrate="511276.52" height="720">
    <podcast:source uri="https://example.com/file-720.mp4" />

This element defines a method of verifying integrity of the media given either an [SRI-compliant integrity string](https://www.w3.org/TR/SRI/) (preferred) or a base64 encoded PGP signature.  This element is optional within a
`<podcast:alternateEnclosure>` element.  It allows to ensure that the file has not been tampered with.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<podcast:alternateEnclosure>`

### Count
&nbsp; Single

### Attributes
 - **type:** (required) Type of integrity, either "sri" or "pgp-signature".
 - **value:** (required) Value of the sri string or base64 encoded pgp signature.

### Examples
```xml
<podcast:alternateEnclosure type="video/mp4" length="7924786" bitrate="511276.52" height="720">
    <podcast:source uri="https://example.com/file-720.mp4" />

</podcast:alternateEnclosure>
```

## Guid
`<podcast:guid>`<br><br>
This element is used to declare a unique, global identifier for a podcast. The value is a UUIDv5, and is easily 
generated from the RSS feed url, with the **protocol scheme and trailing slashes stripped off**, combined with a 
unique "podcast" namespace which has a UUID of `ead4c236-bf58-58c6-a2c6-a6b28d128cb6`. Tools like [this one](https://www.uuidtools.com/v5) can help generate these values by hand. Or, language libraries like [this one](https://github.com/sporkmonger/uuidtools) in Ruby are widely available. Specifically for podcasts, [this tool from RSS Blue](https://tools.rssblue.com/podcast-guid) can help generate a GUID by hand.

A podcast gets assigned a podcast:guid once in its lifetime using its current feed url (at the time of assignment) 
as the seed value. That GUID is then meant to follow the podcast from then on, for the duration of its life, even if 
the feed url changes. This means that when a podcast moves from one hosting platform to another, its podcast:guid 
should be discovered by the new host and imported into the new platform for inclusion into the feed.

Using this pattern, podcasts can maintain a consistent identity across the open RSS ecosystem without a central 
authority.

**Tips:**
* All podcasts in the Podcast Index have already been assigned a GUID; but if one exists in the RSS feed, that value 
  is canonical.
* You can programmatically spot a GUID: it is 36 characters long, and contains four hyphen characters.
* Be aware that Amazon Music also uses separate UUIDv5 identifiers within their podcast directory, which are 
  calculated differently and unrelated to this specification. 
* The following regular expression (regex) will match a GUID:
```re
[0-9a-fA-F]{8}\-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}\-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}`
```

### Parent
&nbsp; `<channel>`

### Count
&nbsp; Single

### Node Value
&nbsp; The node value is a UUIDv5 string.

### Examples
Example GUID for feed url `mp3s.nashownotes.com/pc20rss.xml`:
```xml
<podcast:guid>917393e3-1b1e-5cef-ace4-edaa54e1f810</podcast:guid>
```

Example GUID for feed url `podnews.net/rss`:
```xml
<podcast:guid>9b024349-ccf0-5f69-a609-6b82873eab3c</podcast:guid>
```

### Guid-enabled fast-follow share links

&nbsp; The `podcast:guid` value above enables podcasters to produce a link that can share a podcast on a variety of 
different platforms.

&nbsp; The format of the link is `https://(a podcast website link)#fastfollow-(type):(a podcast guid)`

&nbsp; `type` is currently `podcast`, but may be extended in future.

&nbsp; A working example is https://podnews.net/podcast/i8xe9/listen#fastfollow-podcast:9b024349-ccf0-5f69-a609-6b82873eab3c or the QR code given below.

&nbsp; ![podnews-qr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/231941/127796108-d819de43-6c0e-4c7b-9579-ed1f19989443.png)

&nbsp; When scanned on a mobile phone's camera app, this link will go to the specified podcast website. Behavior of 
this website is up to the creator: some may use a default homepage, others may sniff the useragent and open a 
default podcast app on a device. In the working example, above, an iPhone user may be taken to Apple Podcasts; an 
Android user may be taken to Google Podcasts; and another device will be given a page with a player.

&nbsp; When scanned on a QR code reader inside a podcast app, like [CurioCaster](https://curiocaster.com/), the app 
can parse the `podcast:guid` value from the URL, allowing the podcast to be opened within the application.

## Value
`<podcast:value>`<br><br>
This element designates the cryptocurrency or payment layer that will be used, the transport method for transacting 
the payments, and a suggested amount denominated in the given cryptocurrency.

This element can exist at either the `<channel>` or `<item>` level.  When it exists at the `<item>` level, it should 
be treated as an "override" of whatever is defined at the `<channel>` level.

This is a complex tag, so implementors are HIGHLY encouraged to read the companion [document](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/value/value.md) for a complete understanding of how
this tag works and what it is capable of.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<channel>` or `<item>`

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Node Value
&nbsp; The node value must be one or more `<podcast:valueRecipient>` elements.

### Attributes
 - **type:** (required) This is the service slug of the cryptocurrency or protocol layer.
 - **method:** (required) This is the transport mechanism that will be used.
 - **suggested:** (optional) This is an optional suggestion on how much cryptocurrency to send with each payment.

### Examples
```xml
<podcast:value
    type="lightning"
    method="keysend"
    suggested="0.00000005000"
></podcast:value>
```



<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Value Recipient
`<podcast:valueRecipient>`<br><br>
The `valueRecipient` tag designates various destinations for payments to be sent to during consumption of the 
enclosed media.  Each recipient is considered to receive a "split" of the total payment according to the number of 
shares given in the `split` attribute.

This element may only exist within a parent `<podcast:value>` element.

There is no limit on how many `valueRecipient` elements can be present in a given `<podcast:value>` element.

This is a complex tag, so implementors are HIGHLY encouraged to read the companion [document](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/value/value.md) for a complete understanding of how this tag works
and what it is capable of.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<podcast:value>`

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Attributes
 - **name** (recommended) A free-form string that designates who or what this recipient is.
 - **customKey** (optional) The name of a custom record key to send along with the payment.
 - **customValue** (optional) A custom value to pass along with the payment. This is considered the value that 
   belongs to the `customKey`.
 - **type** (required) A slug that represents the type of receiving address that will receive the payment.
 - **address** (required) This denotes the receiving address of the payee.
 - **split** (required) The number of shares of the payment this recipient will receive.
 - **fee** (optional) If this attribute is not specified, it is assumed to be false.

### Examples
```xml
<podcast:value type="lightning" method="keysend" suggested="0.00000015000">
  <podcast:valueRecipient
      name="Alice (Podcaster)"
      type="node"

      fee="true"
  />
</podcast:value>
```



<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Medium
`<podcast:medium>`<br><br>
The `medium` tag tells an application what the content contained within the feed IS, as opposed to what the 
content is ABOUT in the case of a category.  This allows a podcast app to modify it's behavior or UI to give a 
better experience to the user for this content.  For example, if a podcast has 
`<podcast:medium>music</podcast:medium>` an app may choose to reset playback speed to 1x and adjust it's EQ settings 
to be better for music vs. spoken word.

Accepted medium names are curated within a list maintained by the community as new mediums are discovered over time. 
Newly proposed mediums should require some level of justification to be added to this list. One may argue and/or 
prove use of a new medium even for only one application, should it prove different enough from existing mediums to 
have meaning.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<channel>`

### Count
&nbsp; Single

### Node Value
The node value is a string denoting one of the following possible values:
- `podcast` (default) - Describes a feed for a podcast show. If no `medium` tag is present in the channel, this 
  medium is assumed.
- `music` - A feed of music organized into an "album" with each item a song within the album.
- `video` - Like a "podcast" but used in a more visual experience.  Something akin to a dedicated video channel like 
  would be found on YouTube.
- `film` - Specific types of videos with one item per feed. This is different than a `video` medium because the 
  content is considered to be cinematic; like a movie or documentary.
- `audiobook` - Specific types of audio with one item per feed, or where items represent chapters within the book.
- `newsletter` - Describes a feed of curated written articles.  Newsletter articles now sometimes have an spoken 
  version audio enclosure attached.
- `blog` - Describes a feed of informally written articles.  Similar to `newsletter` but more informal as in a 
  traditional blog platform style.
- `publisher` - Describes a feed that links to other feeds a publisher owns using the `<podcast:remoteItem>` element.
  To understand the structure of how "publisher" feeds work, please see the dedicated document 
  [here](/publishers/publishers.md) and the `<podcast:publisher>` tag [here](#publisher).
- `course` - A feed of training material (audio or video courses) with each item being a session or chapter of the 
  course or conference track.

### List Mediums
In addition to the above mediums, each medium also has a counterpart "list" variant, where the original medium name 
is suffixed by the letter "L" to indicate that it is a "List" of that type of content. For example, `podcast` would 
become `podcastL`, `music` would become `musicL`, `audiobook` would become `audiobookL`, etc.

There is also a dedicated list medium for mixed content:
- `mixed` - This list medium type describes a feed of `<podcast:remoteItem>`'s that point to different remote medium 
  types.  For instance, a single list feed might point to music, podcast and audiobook items in other feeds.  An 
  example would be a personal consumption history feed.

A "list" medium feed should not be expected to have regular `<item>`'s,`<podcast:liveItem>`'s, or any future 
similar new item type. Rather, a "List" feed is intended to exclusively contain one or more `<podcast:remoteItem>`'s,
allowing one to reference a feed by its `<podcast:guid>` and the guid of an item.

### Examples
Example use for a standard "podcast" feed:
```xml
<podcast:medium>podcast</podcast:medium>
```

Example use for a "music" feed:
```xml
<podcast:medium>music</podcast:medium>
```

Example use for a "music" playlist feed:
```xml

## Images
`<podcast:images>`<br><br>
This tag, when present, allows for specifying many different image sizes in a compact way at either the episode or 
channel level.  The syntax is borrowed from the HTML5 [srcset](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#srcset-attributes) syntax.  It allows for describing multiple image sources with width and pixel hints directly
in the attribute.  Although the HTML5 `srcset` attribute allows relative urls, absolute urls are required in this 
tag - since the feed url may not represent an appropriate base url for relativization.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<channel>` or `<item>`

### Count
&nbsp; Single

### Attributes
 - **srcset** (required) A string that denotes each image url followed by a space and the pixel width, with each one 
   separated by a comma.  See the example for a clear view of the syntax.

### Examples
Example of specifying four different image sizes:
```xml
<podcast:images
    srcset="https://example.com/images/ep1/pci_avatar-massive.jpg 1500w,
            https://example.com/images/ep1/pci_avatar-middle.jpg 600w,
            https://example.com/images/ep1/pci_avatar-small.jpg 300w,
            https://example.com/images/ep1/pci_avatar-tiny.jpg 150w"
/>
```



<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Live Item
`<podcast:liveItem>`<br><br>
The `liveItem` tag is used for a feed to deliver a live audio or video stream to podcast apps.  It takes the same 
format as a standard `<item>` episode tag, and all tags that are allowed as children of a normal `<item>` are also 
allowed as children of `<podcast:liveItem>`.  Note that "allowed" is not the same as "supported".  So, just like a 
normal `<item>`, you cannot depend on all apps to support all tags within `<podcast:liveItem>`, especially when the 
function of the tag is not obvious.  For instance, including an `<itunes:duration>` tag in a live item is probably a 
waste of time since apps will not know what to do with that value in the context of live media.

This tag will also make use of the [podping](https://podping.cloud) notification network.  A podping notification 
SHOULD be sent out by the host when the live stream starts, to let apps know.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<channel>`

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Node Value
All tags that are valid as children of a standard `<item>` tag are also valid as children here.

When specifying the audio/video source, the [`<podcast:alternateEnclosure>`](#alternate-enclosure) tag is highly 
encouraged since it gives the broadest coverage of possible stream types and is explicit in it's communication of 
what transport protocol and media codecs are being used. In addition to [`<podcast:alternateEnclosure>`](#alternate-enclosure), a standard [`<enclosure>`](https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.
html#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt) should also be given as a fallback to support podcast apps that don't yet 
implement [`<podcast:alternateEnclosure>`](#alternate-enclosure). 

Regardless of which enclosure tag is used, feed 
owners must be conscious of the fact that choosing a non-mainstream streaming protocol/codec will limit the number 
of apps that can play the content.  For that reason, it's highly recommended to use only the two most widely 
supported protocols (mp3 and mp4/h.264) to ensure compatibility with the broadest number of apps on various 
platforms.  Choosing a streaming format that is outside of this narrow list might exclude many apps from playing 
your content.  As broader adoption of HLS, Opus, etc. becomes apparent, this recommendation will change to include 
newer formats.

The [`<podcast:contentLink>`](#content-link) tag is also required to be present, to ensure that listeners have a 
fallback option in case their chosen app cannot play the given content stream directly.  In most instances this will 
just be a link to an HTML page that can play the live stream.  Such a page can reside on the podcaster's own website,
a page provided by their hosting company or a third party platform they have chosen to use.  Podcasters who live 
stream to multiple platforms at once can also use the [`<podcast:contentLink>`](#content-link) tag to provide links 
to those other platforms.

A robust, well-written `<podcast:liveItem>` tag will include all three of:  [`<podcast:alternateEnclosure>`](#alternate-enclosure), [`<enclosure>`](https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltenclosuregtSubelementOfLtitemgt)
and [`<podcast:contentLink>`](#content-link) to ensure the broadest interopability with podcast apps.

The function of `<guid>` within a live item tag is the same as it is within a regular item.  If the `<guid>` of a 
`<podcast:liveItem>` changes, it MUST be considered a new stream by podcast apps.

### Attributes
 - **status** (required) A string that must be one of `pending`, `live` or `ended`.
 - **start** (required) A string representing an ISO8601 timestamp that denotes the time when the stream is intended 
   to start.
 - **end** (recommended) A string representing an ISO8601 timestamp that denotes the time when the stream is intended 
   to end.

The `start` and `end` attributes denote when the live stream "should" start and end.  But, real life dictates that 
those times might not be adhered to.  Apps are therefore encouraged not to rely solely on those times as anything 
more than an approximation.  The canonical way to know if a stream has started is with the `status` attribute.  If 
`status` is "live" then the stream has started.

### Examples
A complete example:
```xml
<podcast:liveItem status="live" start="2021-09-26T07:30:00.000-0600" end="2021-09-26T09:30:00.000-0600">

## Content Link
`<podcast:contentLink>`<br><br>
The `contentLink` tag is used to indicate that the content being delivered by the parent element can be found at an 
external location instead of, or in addition to, the tag itself within an app.  In most 
instances it is used as a fallback link for the user to use when the app itself can't handle a certain content 
delivery directly.

For instance, perhaps a podcast feed specifies a `<podcast:liveItem>` to deliver a live stream to apps.  The feed 
may also give a `<podcast:contentLink>` pointing to YouTube and Twitch versions of the live stream as well, just in 
case the listener uses an app that doesn't fully support live streaming content.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<item>` or `<podcast:liveItem>`

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Node Value
The node value is a free-form string meant to explain to the user where this content link points and/or the nature 
of its purpose.

### Attributes
 - **href** (required) A string that is the uri pointing to content outside of the application.

### Examples

(under `<item>`)

```xml
<podcast:contentLink href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c7HWZROxD8">Watch this episode on YouTube!</podcast:contentLink>
```

(under `<podcast:liveItem>`)

```xml
<podcast:contentLink href="https://youtube.com/blahblah/livestream">Live on YouTube!</podcast:contentLink>
```

```xml
<podcast:contentLink href="https://twitter.com/statuses/somepost">Chat on Twitter!</podcast:contentLink>

`<podcast:socialInteract>`<br><br>
The `socialInteract` tag allows a podcaster to attach the url of a "root post" of a comment thread to an episode, or 
to the podcast as a whole. This "root post" is treated as the canonical location of where the comments and 
discussion around the episode or podcast will take place.  This can be thought of as the "official" social media 
comment space for the episode or podcast.  If a protocol such as "activitypub" is used, or some other protocol that 
allows programmatic API access, these comments can be directly pulled into the app, and replies can be posted back 
to the thread from the app itself.

If multiple `socialInteract` tags are given for an `<item>` or the `<channel>`, the `priority` attribute is strongly 
recommended to give the app an indication as to which comments to display first.

This tag can also be used as a signal to platforms and apps that the podcaster does not want public comments shown 
alongside the episode or podcast.  For this purpose a `protocol` value of "disabled" can be specified, with no other 
attributes or node value present.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<item>` or `<channel>`

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Attributes
- **protocol** (required) The [protocol](/socialprotocols.txt) in use for interacting with the comment root post.
- **uri** (required) The uri/url of root post comment.
- **accountId** (recommended) The account id (on the commenting platform) of the account that created this root post.
- **accountUrl** (optional) The public url (on the commenting platform) of the account that created this root post.
- **priority** (optional) When multiple socialInteract tags are present, this integer gives order of priority.  A 
  lower number means higher priority.


Example (simple):
```xml
<podcast:socialInteract
        protocol="activitypub"
        uri="https://podcastindex.social/web/@dave/108013847520053258"
        accountId="@dave" 
/>
```

Example (complex):
```xml
<podcast:socialInteract
        priority="1"
        protocol="activitypub"
        uri="https://podcastindex.social/web/@dave/108013847520053258"
        accountId="@dave" 
        accountUrl="https://podcastindex.social/web/@dave" 
/>
<podcast:socialInteract 
        priority="2"
        protocol="twitter"
        uri="https://twitter.com/PodcastindexOrg/status/1507120226361647115"
        accountId="@podcastindexorg" 
        accountUrl="https://twitter.com/PodcastindexOrg" 
/>
```

Example (disabled):
```xml
<podcast:socialInteract protocol="disabled" />
```

* For **activitypub**, Mastodon or Pleroma's posting API returns a URI (a fully-formed URL with a GUID in it), and a 
  URL (the HTML page where the comment lives). While both of these are acceptable values for the `uri` field 
  referenced in the `socialInteract` specification, we'd recommend using the URI value.

## Block
`<podcast:block>`<br><br>
This element allows a podcaster to express which platforms are allowed to publicly display this feed and its 
contents. In its basic form, it is a direct drop-in replacement for the `<itunes:block>` tag, but allows for greater 
flexibility by the inclusion of the `id` attribute and by including multiple copies of itself in the feed.

Platforms should not ingest a feed for public display/use if their slug exists in the `id` of a `yes` block tag, or 
if an unbounded `yes` block tag exists (meaning block all public ingestion).  Conversely, if a platform finds their 
slug in the `id` of a `no` block tag, they are free to ingest that feed for public display/usage.

In plain language, the sequence of discovery an ingesting platform should use is as follows:

 1. Does `<podcast:block id="[myslug]">no</podcast:block>` exist in this feed?  Safe to ingest.
 2. Does `<podcast:block id="[myslug]">yes</podcast:block>` exist in this feed?  Do not ingest.
 3. Does `<podcast:block>yes</podcast:block>` exist in this feed?  Do not ingest.


### Parent
&nbsp; `<channel>`

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Attributes
 - **id** (optional) A single entry from the [service slug list](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/serviceslugs.txt).

### Node value
&nbsp; The node value must be "yes" or "no".

### Examples
```xml
<!-- This means "block everything" -->
<podcast:block>yes</podcast:block>
```

```xml
<!-- This means "block nothing" (same as not present) -->
<podcast:block>no</podcast:block>
```

```xml
<!-- This means "block only google and amazon" -->
<podcast:block id="google">yes</podcast:block>
<podcast:block id="amazon">yes</podcast:block>
```

```xml
<!-- This means "block every platform _except_ google and amazon" -->
<podcast:block>yes</podcast:block>
<podcast:block id="google">no</podcast:block>
<podcast:block id="amazon">no</podcast:block>

## Txt
`<podcast:txt>`<br><br>
This element holds free-form text and is modeled after the DNS "[TXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_record)" 
record.  It's meant to allow for usages that might be niche or otherwise not rise to the level of needing a 
dedicated tag.  Just like TXT records in DNS allowed for new things like [SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework#Implementation) to evolve, this tag can allow novel techniques to be created and 
sandboxed without a formalization process.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<channel>` or `<item>`

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Attributes
- **purpose** (optional)  A service specific string that will be used to denote what purpose this tag serves. This 
  could be something like "example.com" if it's a third party hosting platform needing to insert this data, or 
  something like "verify", "release" or any other free form bit of info that is useful to the end consumer that 
  needs it. The free form nature of this tag requires that this attribute is also free formed. This value should not 
  exceed `128 characters`.

### Purposes
The following are a list of strings known to be in common use. This list is in no way exhaustive. As new purposes 
come into common use, this list will be updated by the community to reflect that.

- `verify` - The node value is expected to contain a string that is given by a third party platform to a podcaster 
  in order to prove that they are the owner of the feed and are in control of it. This is meant to replace the need 
  for emails to exist in feeds. See example section below.

- `applepodcastsverify` - Same as above but [used](https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390:~:text=podcast%3Atxt%20purpose%3D%E2%80%9C-,applepodcastsverify,-%E2%80%9D%3E) by Apple.

### Node value
&nbsp;   This is a free form string. Please do not exceed `4000 characters` for the node value or it may be 
truncated by aggregators.

### Examples
```xml
<podcast:txt>naj3eEZaWVVY9a38uhX8FekACyhtqP4JN</podcast:txt>
```

```xml
<podcast:txt purpose="verify">S6lpp-7ZCn8-dZfGc-OoyaG</podcast:txt>
```

```xml
<podcast:txt purpose="applepodcastsverify">05124</podcast:txt>

<podcast:txt purpose="release">2022-10-26T04:45:30.742Z</podcast:txt>
```

## Remote Item
`<podcast:remoteItem>`<br><br>
This element provides a way to "point" to another feed or an `<item>` in another feed in order to obtain some sort 
of data that the other feed or feed item has.  This allows a podcast app to know where to go and fetch the data 
being requested.  What data is being requested is determined by the parent item.  For instance, if the parent item 
is a `<podcast:podroll>` element, then the remote feed's `<channel>` metadata is needed.

Using the `feedGuid` attribute is the preferred way to address a remote feed since, but there are times when an app 
may not have access to a list of resolvable `<podcast:guid>`'s.  In that case, it can be beneficial to include the 
`feedUrl` attribute for those cases as a fallback.  If both are present and the app is capable the `feedGuid` should 
be resolved and used.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<channel>` or `<podcast:podroll>` or `<podcast:valueTimeSplit>` or `<podcast:publisher>`

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Attributes
- **feedGuid** (required) The `<podcast:guid>` of the remote feed being pointed to.
- **feedUrl** (optional) The url of the remote feed being pointed to.
- **itemGuid** (optional) If this remote item element is intended to point to an `<item>` in the remote feed, this 
  attribute should contain the value of the `<guid>` of that `<item>`. 
- **medium** (optional) If the feed being pointed to is not of medium type 'podcast', this attribute should contain 
  it's `<podcast:medium>` type from the [list](#medium) of types available in this document. The reason this is 
  helpful is to give the app a heads up on what type of data this is expected to be since that may affect the way it 
  approaches fetch and display.
- **title** (optional) A string that represents the title of the remote item.  The purpose of this attribute is to give
  a hint to apps so that they can display the title without having to do a remote lookup.

### Examples
```xml
<podcast:remoteItem feedGuid="917393e3-1b1e-5cef-ace4-edaa54e1f810" />
```

```xml
<podcast:remoteItem
    feedGuid="917393e3-1b1e-5cef-ace4-edaa54e1f810"
    itemGuid="asdf089j0-ep240-20230510"
/>
```

```xml
<podcast:remoteItem
    feedGuid="917393e3-1b1e-5cef-ace4-edaa54e1f810"
    feedUrl="https://feeds.example.org/917393e3-1b1e-5cef-ace4-edaa54e1f810/rss.xml"
    itemGuid="asdf089j0-ep240-20230510"

"recommending" other podcasts to their listener.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<channel>`

### Count

## Update Frequency
`<podcast:updateFrequency>`<br><br>
This element allows a podcaster to express their intended release schedule as structured data and text.

### Parent
`<channel>`

### Count
Single

### Node value
The node value is a free-form string, which might be displayed alongside other information about the podcast. Please 
do not exceed `128 characters` for the node value or it may be truncated by aggregators.

### Attributes
* **complete (optional):** Boolean specifying if the podcast has no intention to release further episodes. If not 
  set, this should be assumed to be false.
* **dtstart (optional):** The `date` or `datetime` the recurrence rule begins as an [ISO8601-fornmatted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString) string. If the
  `rrule` contains a value for `COUNT`, then this attribute is required. If the `rrule` contains a value for `UNTIL`,
  then the value of this attribute must be formatted to the same date/datetime standard.
* **rrule (recommended):** A recurrence rule as defined in [iCalendar RFC 5545 Section 3.3.10](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5545#section-3.3.10).

### Examples
Recreating most of Apple Podcasts Connect’s “Update Frequency” values is easily achieved:
```xml
<podcast:updateFrequency rrule="FREQ=DAILY">Daily</podcast:updateFrequency>

<podcast:updateFrequency rrule="FREQ=WEEKLY">Weekly</podcast:updateFrequency>

<podcast:updateFrequency rrule="FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2">Biweekly</podcast:updateFrequency>

<podcast:updateFrequency rrule="FREQ=MONTHLY">Monthly</podcast:updateFrequency>

<podcast:updateFrequency rrule="FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=2">Bimonthly</podcast:updateFrequency>

<podcast:updateFrequency rrule="FREQ=MONTHLY">Monthly</podcast:updateFrequency>

<podcast:updateFrequency rrule="FREQ=YEARLY">Yearly</podcast:updateFrequency>
```

However, greater precision can be easily communicated:
```xml
<podcast:updateFrequency rrule="FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR">Every weekday</podcast:updateFrequency>

<podcast:updateFrequency rrule="FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,WE">Every Monday and Wednesday</podcast:updateFrequency>

<podcast:updateFrequency rrule="FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=FR;BYMONTHDAY=13">Every friday the 13th</podcast:updateFrequency>

<podcast:updateFrequency rrule="FREQ=YEARLY;BYDAY=+4TH;BYMONTH=11">
    Every year on American Thanksgiving
</podcast:updateFrequency>
```

Limited-run podcasts can indicate when they’ll go on hiatus by setting an UNTIL date or a COUNT:
```xml
<podcast:updateFrequency rrule="FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2;BYDAY=MO;COUNT=10" dtstart="2023-08-28T00:00:00.000Z">
    Every other Monday for 10 episodes starting on Aug 28, 2023
</podcast:updateFrequency>

<podcast:updateFrequency rrule="FREQ=WEEKLY;UNTIL=2023-12-31T00:00:00.000Z;BYDAY=MO">
    Every Monday until Dec 31, 2023
</podcast:updateFrequency>
```

Podcasts currently on hiatus can indicate their intention to resume production by setting a DTSTART value in the future:
```xml
<podcast:updateFrequency dtstart="2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" rrule="FREQ=WEEKLY">
    Weekly, starting in 2025
</podcast:updateFrequency>
```

Complete podcasts with no intention to release further episodes:
```xml
<podcast:updateFrequency complete="true">That’s all folks!</podcast:updateFrequency>
```

## Podping
`<podcast:podping>`<br><br>
This element allows feed owners to signal to aggregators that the feed sends out
[`Podping`](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podping) notifications when changes are made to it, reducing the 
need for frequent speculative feed polling.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<channel>`

&nbsp; Single

## Examples
```xml
 <podcast:podping usesPodping="true"/>
```



<br><br><br><br><!-- Tag block -->
## Value Time Split
`<podcast:valueTimeSplit>`<br><br>
This element allows different value splits for a certain period of time. It is a combination of the concept of 
<podcast:soundbite> and <podcast:remoteItem> where a start time and a duration is supplied with alternative value 
recipients. The alternative value recipients are not required to be remote, as the recipients may not have an RSS 
feed/item of their own to reference.

The `<podcast:valueTimeSplit>` element allows time-based changes of value recipient information during playback of a 
feed's enclosure content.

This can either contain one or more `<podcast:valueRecipient>` tags *or* exactly one `<podcast:remoteItem>` tag. If 
a `<podcast:remoteItem>` tag is present, the `remotePercentage` attribute can be defined to control how much the 
remote value block's `<podcast:valueRecipient>` tags will receive as a whole on top of the default, non-fee 
`<podcast:valueRecipient>` tags.

If the remote value block contains any `<podcast:valueTimeSplit>` tags, they should be ignored even if the 
`remoteStartTime` indicates it's in a position that would invoke them. When referencing a remote value block, only 
the root level block splits should be used and any `<podcast:valueTimeSplit>` children are to be ignored.

Fees from the default `<podcast:valueRecipient>` tags should remain to be calculated before anything is taken out 
from `<podcast:valueTimeSplit>`.

### Parent
&nbsp; `<podcast:value>`

### Count
&nbsp; Multiple

### Node Value
&nbsp; A single `<podcast:remoteItem>` element OR one or more `<podcast:valueRecipient>` elements.

### Attributes
- `startTime` (required) - The time, in seconds, to stop using the currently active value recipient information and 
  start using the value recipient information contained in this element.
- `duration` (required) - How many seconds the playback app should use this element's value recipient information 
  before switching back to the value recipient information of the parent feed.
- `remoteStartTime` (optional) - The time in the remote item where the value split begins.  Allows the timestamp to 
  be set correctly in value metadata.  If not defined, defaults to 0.
- `remotePercentage` (optional) - The percentage of the payment the remote recipients will receive if a 
  `<podcast:remoteItem>` is present.  If not defined, defaults to 100.  If the value is less than 0, 0 is assumed.  
  If the value is greater than 100, 100 is assumed.

## Chat
`<podcast:chat>`<br><br>
This element allows a podcaster to attach information to either the `<channel>`, `<item>` or `<podcast:liveItem>` about 
where the "official" chat for either the podcast or a specific episode or live event is to be found.  Just like 
`<podcast:socialInteract>` functions for social media, the `<podcast:chat>` tag will function for ephemeral chat. 
There are many protocols in use across the internet for chat based communication.  This tag is meant to be flexible 
enough to adapt to whichever protocol the podcaster wants to use.

This element's presence at a particular level governs how it should be treated.  If found at the `<item>` or 
`<podcast:liveItem>` level, this should be treated as the information for that specific episode, overriding what is 
at the `<channel>` level.  If this tag is found at the `<channel>` level, it would be considered the chat for the entire 
podcast and is recommended to be an "always on" chat room experience.

If a podcast has an "always on" style chat service it is recommended to link that at the `<channel>` level and do not
use the `<podcast:chat>` tag at the `<item>` or `<podcast:liveItem>` level.
 
### Parent

### Attributes
- `server` (required) The fqdn of a chat server that serves as the "bootstrap" server to connect to.
- `protocol` (required) The [protocol](chatprotocols.txt) in use on the server.
- `accountId` (recommended) The account id of the podcaster on the server or platform being connected to.
- `space` (optional) Some chat systems have a notion of a chat "space" or "room" or "topic". This attribute will serve
  that purpose.

### Example (IRC):
```xml
<podcast:chat 
    server="irc.zeronode.net" 
    protocol="irc" 
    accountId="@jsmith" 
    space="#myawesomepodcast" 
/>
```

### Example (XMPP):
```xml
<podcast:chat 
    server="jabber.example.com"
    protocol="xmpp"
    accountId="jsmith@jabber.example.org" 
    space="myawesomepodcast@jabber.example.org" 
/>
```

### Example (Nostr):
```xml
<podcast:chat 
    server="relay.example.com" 
    protocol="nostr" 
    accountId="npub1pvdw7mm7k20t9dn9gful8n5xua5yv8rmgd9wul88qq5dxj80lpxqd39r3u"

    space="#general:example.com" 
/>
```

## Publisher
`<podcast:publisher>`<br><br>
This element allows a podcast feed to link to it's "publisher feed" parent.  This is useful when a parent publishing 
entity wants to attest ownership over all of the podcast feeds it owns/publishes.  This element must contain exactly 
one `<podcast:remoteItem medium="publisher">` element pointing to the publisher feed.  For widest compatibility, it is 
highly recommended to use the `feedUrl` attribute of the `<podcast:remoteItem>` element in this capacity.

For complete implementation details regarding publisher feeds and how to create them, please see the full publisher 
feed [documentation](/publishers/publishers.md) and the `publisher` medium [here](#medium).

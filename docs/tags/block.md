# Block

`<podcast:block>`

This element allows a podcaster to express which platforms are allowed to publicly display this feed and its contents. In its basic form, it is a direct drop-in replacement for the `<itunes:block>` tag, but allows for greater flexibility by the inclusion of the `id` attribute and by including multiple copies of itself in the feed.

Platforms should not ingest a feed for public display/use if their slug exists in the `id` of a `yes` block tag, or if an unbounded `yes` block tag exists (meaning block all public ingestion). Conversely, if a platform finds their slug in the `id` of a `no` block tag, they are free to ingest that feed for public display/usage.

In plain language, the sequence of discovery an ingesting platform should use is as follows:

1. Does `<podcast:block id="[myslug]">no</podcast:block>` exist in this feed? Safe to ingest.
2. Does `<podcast:block id="[myslug]">yes</podcast:block>` exist in this feed? Do not ingest.
3. Does `<podcast:block>yes</podcast:block>` exist in this feed? Do not ingest.

### Attributes

- `url` **(required)**: URL of the podcast transcript.
- `type` **(required)**: Mime type of the file such as `text/plain`, `text/html`, `text/vtt`, `application/json`, `application/x-subrip`
- `language` (optional): The language of the linked transcript. If there is no language attribute given, the linked file is assumed to be the same language that is specified by the RSS `<language>` element.
- `rel` (optional): If the `rel="captions"` attribute is present, the linked file is considered to be a closed captions file, regardless of what the mime type is. In that scenario, time codes are assumed to be present in the file in some capacity.

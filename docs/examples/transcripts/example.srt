1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:02,399
Travis: When you first get
started in podcasting, it's

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,799
almost guaranteed that you're
going to make a handful of rookie

3
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:07,980
mistakes, but that doesn't mean
that you have to make all the

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,109
mistakes. So in this special
bonus podcast episode, we went

5
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:16,109
back through the archives of the
podcasting Q and a show, and five

6
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:19,500
minute Mondays to pull together
the 10 things we wish we knew

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,289
before starting our very first
podcast . Now, as you're

8
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:25,350
listening to this episode, you'll
hear some sound effects pop in

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,750
from time to time. And that's
simply because we pulled these

10
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:31,109
clips from our YouTube channel,
where we add animations and

11
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:34,200
different sequences to help
visually communicate the things

12
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,899
we're discussing. So when those
things pop up, that's what that

13
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:40,590
is. If you are wondering, but
they're not overly distracting.

14
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:43,320
So you'll still be able to get
the gist of what we're talking

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,840
about and hopefully be able to
take one of these things and

16
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:48,990
implement it. Moving forward for
your podcast to help you reach

17
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,340
your goals, that much faster

18
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,770
Sarah: Creating good audio is
really key to keeping your

19
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:01,579
podcast listeners engaged because
no matter how good the content

20
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:04,939
is, if your audio quality isn't
good. It's unfortunately just

21
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:08,359
going to turn them away. I know
what you're thinking is you

22
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:11,359
probably think you have to spend
thousands of dollars on equipment

23
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:14,090
or rent a podcasting studio just
to make sure everything sounds

24
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,930
great. And I'm here to tell you
that's not true at all. I have

25
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,400
created some pretty good audio
from mic's that costs less than a

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,129
hundred dollars. And I have also
recorded in places like in my

27
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:29,239
home office, even in the closet.
Yes, no. One's going to see you

28
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,599
unless you're recording video
like this one , um , wherever you

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,170
can just to muffle the sound is
going to be really make that

30
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:40,189
difference between air quality
and good quality.

31
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:44,840
Travis: Now, when you're creating
your podcast intro, there's a

32
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,750
couple of things that you want to
make sure that you cover a couple

33
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:50,299
of things that you want to make
sure that you say the first one

34
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:54,950
is who you are specifically,
like, what is your name? So you

35
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,299
can start. Your podcast is, Hey,
welcome to my podcast. My name is

36
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:02,780
Travis, Albritton, and then your
credentials. Why should someone

37
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:06,019
listen to you? So if you have
experience in whatever you're

38
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:09,110
talking about, you want to make
sure that you mentioned that if

39
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,900
you went to school for something,
if you have a job doing

40
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:14,569
something, if you have clients
that you work with, you want to

41
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,219
mention the things that lend
credence to your advice. This is

42
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:23,419
a specifically important. If your
podcast is centered around you

43
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,849
and your expertise, the next
thing that you want to make sure

44
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,229
to include in your podcast intro
is what your podcast is about in

45
00:02:30,289 --> 00:02:33,979
this podcast. For instance,
podcasting una. At the very

46
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,069
beginning, we talk about, well,
one, what is it that we're going

47
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,969
to discuss? And then our opening
tagline is that we're giving you

48
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:44,659
tips and strategies to launch,
grow and monetize your podcast.

49
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,520
So if you're a podcaster that
speaks directly to you because

50
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,189
you're listening to this, or
you're watching this because

51
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:54,590
you're looking for those tips and
you want to think through, for

52
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,189
your podcast in a similar way,
what is it that people are

53
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,389
looking for? And then how do you
make sure that you address that

54
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,180
in your intro? So they're going
to continue to listen, not just

55
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:08,139
to the one episode, but to every
single episode, it'll actually

56
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,590
turn into a subscriber that then
goes on to download everything

57
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,930
that you have. And then the third
thing that you want to make sure

58
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:18,370
you mentioned in your podcast
intro is why someone should care.

59
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,479
Why should anyone care that your
podcast exists? Are they going to

60
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,060
lose weight? Are they going to be
happier? Are the relationships

61
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:27,610
going to get better? Are they
going to make money, save money?

62
00:03:27,969 --> 00:03:32,289
What is it that you were offering
to them? What is the end result

63
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,870
look like for them, if they not
only listened to your podcast,

64
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,939
but then also put it into
practice.

65
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,509
Gilon: So is there an ideal
podcast length, short answer?

66
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:46,979
Nope. Joe Rogan has some episodes
that are three hours long, but

67
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,800
then there are other podcasts
that do just fine and are very

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,310
successful at 10 minutes or less.
The reality is we love podcasts

69
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,400
because of the content that
they're presenting. And so if it

70
00:03:56,401 --> 00:04:00,000
takes you 10 minutes to get out
great glorious content, amazing.

71
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,960
If you have some podcast episodes
that are on the longer end, maybe

72
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:07,590
up to three hours, that's okay.
Too. People come to the podcast

73
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:11,310
to get the content, to get what
you say weekly. And to be honest,

74
00:04:11,311 --> 00:04:13,379
there are times when we need just
a quick little something to

75
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:15,599
listen to. And there are times
when we have a lot of space in

76
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,300
our day to listen to something.
It really just depends on what

77
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,579
you're trying to accomplish and
what you're trying to get across.

78
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:26,939
Travis: Be a guest on other
people's podcasts, but not just

79
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:31,319
anyone's podcast podcasts that
have a similar target audience

80
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:34,949
that you do. So let's say for
example, that you talk about

81
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:38,790
online marketing. For instance,
you want to find other podcasts

82
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,800
in your space where they talk
about online marketing, where

83
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,589
they talk about how to grow your
business, where they talk about

84
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:47,519
the entrepreneur life. Because
those are the groups of people

85
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,180
that have already self selected
and said, Hey, I want to hear

86
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,750
this kind of podcast content. If
you can pitch yourself as a guest

87
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,430
to be on those podcasts, then
they will immediately trust you

88
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,639
because they already trust the
podcast host of the podcast

89
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,819
you're guesting on because they
listen to it every week. And then

90
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:08,519
when you're able to demonstrate
your expertise and say at the end

91
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:11,759
of the episode, Hey, by the way,
I also have a podcast where I

92
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:15,149
talk about X, Y, and Z. You're
going to get a good number of

93
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:19,500
people from that podcast to come
over and subscribe to yours.

94
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,240
Gilon: Interviewing noteworthy
guests that have a significant

95
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,000
audience is actually one of our
favorite marketing strategies for

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,470
podcasters. The only thing is the
guest has to promote the episode.

97
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:33,959
Ideally, you want to make it as
easy as possible for them to

98
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:37,050
promote the episode. So some
things that you can do are

99
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,319
creating an audio gram or a
social media graphic for

100
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:43,290
Facebook, for Instagram, whatever
social media platform you promote

101
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,350
on. That's a really easy way to
get them to share that episode

102
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,779
when you have that created and
it's made right there for them

103
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,480
and you give it to them. The
second thing that you can do is

104
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,389
create a blurb for them to
include in their newsletter about

105
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:57,740
the episode. Hey, this is an
episode about X, Y, and you send

106
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,930
that over to them. They can push
that right out to their people

107
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:03,290
via email. The other thing that
you can do is provide a direct

108
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,620
link where people can listen to
the episode. The idea is that it

109
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,920
should be as easy as copying and
pasting and pushing out to their

110
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,040
people. You want to have no
reason for them not to share the

111
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,029
episode and promote it.

112
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:21,310
Travis: Use templates, make it
your goal in life as a podcaster,

113
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,110
to never duplicate your work,
whether it's your outlines,

114
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:29,079
whether it's your audio editing
software, your projects that you

115
00:06:29,081 --> 00:06:32,920
work in, your emails that you
send to your guests, anything

116
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,000
that you do consistently spend
some time really make it

117
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,329
unbreakable, make sure that it's
exactly the way that you want it.

118
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,620
And then don't go back and redo
that actually leverage that work

119
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,759
you've done in the past to speed
up future episodes. So let's say

120
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:51,069
for instance, that you have a
guest that you're bringing onto

121
00:06:51,071 --> 00:06:54,970
your show, rather than writing a
custom email from scratch, send

122
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:57,939
them the one that you sent to
your previous guest, but then

123
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,279
change out the first name to
them. It looks like a brand new

124
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:03,550
email because they haven't seen
that email before. And you know

125
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,250
that it has all the details that
they need to know to make sure

126
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,879
they're fully prepared to come on
your episode. Once you finish

127
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,250
your recording and you bring your
interview into your audio editing

128
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,009
software, you shouldn't be
creating a new project from

129
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:19,360
scratch. You should be opening up
a previous episode, saving it as

130
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,470
a duplicate and then rewriting
over the pieces that need to

131
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:26,319
change leaving, intact , your
intro, your outro, and all of

132
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:30,189
your audio preferences. And then
when you're creating your show

133
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,819
notes, they should be copy and
paste from your previous episode,

134
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,370
show notes, and then filling out
the fields and changing

135
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,189
everything. That's different just
by using templates, just by

136
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,060
leveraging your previous work.
And previous efforts for future

137
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:49,089
episodes is going to save you a
ton of time. These show notes is

138
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:52,899
the section of your podcast
episode that allows you to engage

139
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,480
for your listeners, provide some
next steps for those that are

140
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,180
ready to take action on what they
just listened to. And also

141
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,500
persuade someone new to listen to
the episode. The number one best

142
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,269
practice is to use formatting.
All right , a majority of podcast

143
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:11,769
players like Apple podcasts,
Google podcasts , uh , overcast,

144
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:15,490
they support HTML formatting.
That means you could put

145
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,449
paragraph breaks, bullet points
in bed links, all the stuff that

146
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:23,680
you need to do to make your show
notes look nice because when your

147
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,350
show notes are properly
formatted, when it's easy to

148
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,220
navigate within your episode
description, it makes it easier

149
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:32,769
for your listeners to find what
they're looking for. Right?

150
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,139
Instead of combing through
several paragraphs of

151
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,840
information, they can just zip
down to the list of links that

152
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:41,080
you mentioned and click on the
one that they're looking for.

153
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,169
Because remember when someone
goes to your show notes, your

154
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:47,470
episode description, they're
going for a number of reasons.

155
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,129
First reason they heard you
mentioned something in the

156
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,590
podcast and they want to find the
link. They want to learn more.

157
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:57,120
They want to buy that product,
that you, they are looking for a

158
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,730
particular piece of information.
And they're going to take action

159
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,190
on that. The other reason
somebody goes through your show

160
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:05,519
notes or your episode description
is they're not sure that they

161
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,120
want to devote the 30 minutes, 40
minutes hour to listening to the

162
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,539
full episode. And so they see the
title is interesting. They're

163
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:15,960
curious. They want to learn more
and they go to your show notes

164
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:19,169
too , to see some amplifying
information to see is this

165
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:20,519
something that I really want to
listen to?

166
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,570
Sarah: So let's talk about
whether you actually need a

167
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,059
custom podcast website now for
most pod-casters the answer is

168
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:36,950
actually no, because if your
podcast has an RSS feed with a

169
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:42,799
podcast host like Buzzsprout
chances are you already have a

170
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:46,879
podcast website with Buzzsprouts
website, you get a homepage with

171
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,690
links to obviously all of your
episodes that your listeners can

172
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:54,440
listen to. You can also direct
them to different podcast

173
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,350
directories like Apple podcast,
Stitcher and Spotify. If they

174
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:01,429
want to go listen and subscribe
there, and you can also use your

175
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,330
own domain names . So you can
look and feel like your own

176
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,960
podcast website . You're just
looking for a place for people to

177
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:12,110
listen to your episodes. Changes
are you don't need to spend that

178
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,690
money to build your own custom
website.

179
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,820
Gilon: You may think that the
best strategy is to put your

180
00:10:19,821 --> 00:10:23,450
entire episode up on a social
media platform, but actually you

181
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:26,389
want to create teaser content and
teaser content gives them a

182
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,580
little sound bite , just a little
snippet that what's their

183
00:10:28,581 --> 00:10:31,730
appetites want to go listen to
the rest of the episode, wherever

184
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,269
they listen on Apple podcasts or
Spotify, or what have you. So

185
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,940
we're going to talk about what
three things are included in

186
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:40,970
every good social media post. The
first thing that you need is a

187
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:44,000
visual element, right? So people
are scrolling. They're reading,

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,120
whatever. If you post a picture
that causes them to stop. And the

189
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,580
idea is that they stop , they
listen, they read, they engage.

190
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,279
And the picture of visual element
helps them do that. So this can

191
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,830
be a graphic. It could be a
headshot of your guest . It could

192
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:57,259
be an audio gram . The second
thing that you need is a good

193
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,100
hook. Think about what can I say
to make someone want to continue

194
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,370
listening, to go check out the
full episode. It could be a crazy

195
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,799
stat. It could be a really good
quote. It could be a couple of

196
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:09,860
bullet points that summarize the
high points of the episode.

197
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:13,519
Whatever that thing is, put that
in the caption to help encourage

198
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,580
people to go check out the full
episode and finally a link you

199
00:11:16,581 --> 00:11:20,299
want to include a direct link to
that specific podcast episode in

200
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:23,539
your post. If you nail all three
of these elements, you'll not

201
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:27,049
only intrigue new listeners.
You'll also encourage existing

202
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:28,850
subscribers to share your posts
as well,

203
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,809
Travis: Batch production of your
podcast episodes. So anytime that

204
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:38,809
you were producing an episode,
there's so much involved. There's

205
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:43,129
so many moving pieces that need
to happen in a specific order in

206
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,860
order for you to create that
episode. So you have to start

207
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,230
with generating ideas. Then you
have to create outlines or

208
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:50,629
scripts. If you have a scripted
podcast, you have to line up

209
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:53,470
interviews, you need to record
the episode. You need to edit it.

210
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,940
You need to upload it. You need
to schedule it. All of those

211
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,690
things take time. What takes even
more time If you do every single

212
00:12:00,691 --> 00:12:04,200
episode by itself. But let's say
instead that you scheduled all

213
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:07,259
the interviews that you needed
for the entire month in one week,

214
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:09,899
maybe you had to record it on
Tuesday. And to record it on

215
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,570
Thursday, you know , have four
episodes to start working with

216
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,169
that Saturday. You create the
outlines for the rest of the

217
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:18,809
episode. You record the
narration, put it with your intro

218
00:12:18,811 --> 00:12:21,659
and your outro music, and you
export it. You output it to your

219
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,570
podcast host, and now you
schedule it out. You've just done

220
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,759
a month of content in one week.
So if you're looking to optimize

221
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,669
and streamline your workflow even
more beyond templates, the next

222
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:34,769
best thing to do is to batch your
episodes.

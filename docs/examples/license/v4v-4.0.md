# VALUE-4-VALUE MASTER USE LICENSE
### SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING

The Value-4-Value Master Use License and Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the “The Agreement”) is initiated at the time and date of upload of the “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” and as defined by these agreed upon definitions, by and between the herein mentioned parties;

* Value 4 Value; “V4V” also colloquially known as “The Valueverse” is a monetization model that allows for the instant and direct exchange of money, via digital currency, particularly Bitcoin, between a listening audience and the “Owner” of a “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING.” Many people or organizations can share in the exchange of value due to the existence of the “Value Block,” a feature set used when distributing a “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” to the “Valueverse” via “RSS.”  

* Really Simple Syndication: “RSS” is an internet protocol that operates a standardized system for the distribution of certain types of digital content, specifically “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” whereby “applications also referred to as “Apps,” and other “Users,” can access legal ownership information, along with the “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING,” via the “Value Block” in a standardized format known as an “RSS Feed.” 

* Value Block: The “Value Block” also known as “The Split,” is a set of technology instructions, included in the RSS Feed, that identifies monetization recipients and the address of an individual(s) or multiple, digital wallet(s). Multiple recipients and multiple wallets can share in the value block and “Value block” behavior is defined by unique information input by the “Owner” when creating the “RSS Feed” during the upload process. Any “User” of a digital work covered under this license must always honor the information as defined within the “RSS Feed” and the corresponding “Value Block.”

* Owner: The “Owner” is the real and true holder of the “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” which by embodies and may also contain underlying composition(s) created by or with additional “Collaborator Shareholders.” The “Owner” is also, thereby, the real and true owner of the resulting “RSS Feed.” 

* Collaborator Shareholder: Also known as “Rights Holders” are people or organizations that participated in the creation of a “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING.”

* Collaborator Shareholder Agreement: “Collaborator Shareholder Agreement” is the true and legal agreement made by and between the “Owner” of the “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” and their “Collaborators.” Collaborator Shareholders are other financially incentivized partners in the “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING.”

* User: A “User” is any person, company, playlist, application, distributor, or any entity that is using the “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” for any purpose within the “Valueverse.” When so notated, and by the definition of this license and its terms herein, “Users” must honor both this agreement, in combination with, the specific terms identified within the “RSS Feed.”

* Listener: A “Listener” is the end user, fan or follower that is consuming the “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” on or through a Value-4-Value enabled platform and who then instantly, directly, and globally has the option to transfer a monetary value, of their choosing, to the “Owner” using a digital currency, like Bitcoin, via their digital wallet.

* Distributor: A “Distributor” is defined as a mobile or web-based platform or software service that stores a copy of “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” and then creates the underlying “RSS Feed” that is published and makes that “RSS Feed” available to third-party software applications or services (“Apps”) that are value-4-value enabled. 

* Value-4-Value Application: A “V4V-App” is a mobile or web-based platform or software service that enables the instant, global and direct transfer of value to the “Owner.” Value-4-Value “Apps” also enable the exchange of value, in app by connecting the “Listener’s” digital wallet to the “Owner(s)” digital wallet therefore enabling the instant, direct and global exchange of value.

* Value Cast: A “Value Cast” is a value enabled programmer, show, playlist, or App, that is utilizing a “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” by reading and accessing the “RSS Feed.” A “Value Cast” is a promotional partner that helps to positively expand an audience within the “Valueverse.” 

* Value Host: A “Value Host” is a media personality, company, or programmer that utilizes a “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” either, talking about, playing, including, or otherwise promoting the “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” to the “Valueverse.” 

* International Standard Recording Code: An “ISRC Code” is a numeric international identification number for a “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” that is tied to the Ownership of the “RSS Feed” and corresponding copyright information.  The “ISRC Code” shall always become an embedded notation with each license and displayed in app where a “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” is used. 

* Value-4-Value license: The “V4V License” constitutes the allowable use by all parties within the “Valueverse” who thereby agree to take certain precautions against the misuse of the “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” including, but not limited to, a). the prohibited use of “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” in any app that is not value enabled b). the prohibited use in any synchronization or derivative works not approved by the “Owner.” c). all parties agree to properly communicate and educate against the misuse of “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” in public spaces or other venue’s that have no clear or immediate transfer of value between the “Listener” and the “Owner.”

Effective at the time of upload, this “Agreement” is made by and between “The Owner” and any party described herein for the limited use, effective with the notated license and corresponding “ISRC Code” identified and attached to the “SOUND OR VIDEO RECORDING” as described herein, and for use across “The Valueverse” and as follows:

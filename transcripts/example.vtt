00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.399
Travis: When you first get
started in podcasting, it's

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.799
almost guaranteed that you're
going to make a handful of rookie

00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:07.980
mistakes, but that doesn't mean
that you have to make all the

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.109
mistakes. So in this special
bonus podcast episode, we went

00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:16.109
back through the archives of the
podcasting Q and a show, and five

00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:19.500
minute Mondays to pull together
the 10 things we wish we knew

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.289
before starting our very first
podcast . Now, as you're

00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:25.350
listening to this episode, you'll
hear some sound effects pop in

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.750
from time to time. And that's
simply because we pulled these

00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:31.109
clips from our YouTube channel,
where we add animations and

00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:34.200
different sequences to help
visually communicate the things

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.899
we're discussing. So when those
things pop up, that's what that

00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:40.590
is. If you are wondering, but
they're not overly distracting.

00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:43.320
So you'll still be able to get
the gist of what we're talking

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.840
about and hopefully be able to
take one of these things and

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:48.990
implement it. Moving forward for
your podcast to help you reach

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.340
your goals, that much faster

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.770
Sarah: Creating good audio is
really key to keeping your

00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:01.579
podcast listeners engaged because
no matter how good the content

00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:04.939
is, if your audio quality isn't
good. It's unfortunately just

00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:08.359
going to turn them away. I know
what you're thinking is you

00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:11.359
probably think you have to spend
thousands of dollars on equipment

00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:14.090
or rent a podcasting studio just
to make sure everything sounds

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.930
great. And I'm here to tell you
that's not true at all. I have

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.400
created some pretty good audio
from mic's that costs less than a

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.129
hundred dollars. And I have also
recorded in places like in my

00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:29.239
home office, even in the closet.
Yes, no. One's going to see you

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.599
unless you're recording video
like this one , um , wherever you

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.170
can just to muffle the sound is
going to be really make that

00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:40.189
difference between air quality
and good quality.

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.840
Travis: Now, when you're creating
your podcast intro, there's a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.750
couple of things that you want to
make sure that you cover a couple

00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:50.299
of things that you want to make
sure that you say the first one

00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:54.950
is who you are specifically,
like, what is your name? So you

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.299
can start. Your podcast is, Hey,
welcome to my podcast. My name is

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.780
Travis, Albritton, and then your
credentials. Why should someone

00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:06.019
listen to you? So if you have
experience in whatever you're

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:09.110
talking about, you want to make
sure that you mentioned that if

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.900
you went to school for something,
if you have a job doing

00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:14.569
something, if you have clients
that you work with, you want to

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.219
mention the things that lend
credence to your advice. This is

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:23.419
a specifically important. If your
podcast is centered around you

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.849
and your expertise, the next
thing that you want to make sure

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.229
to include in your podcast intro
is what your podcast is about in

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:33.979
this podcast. For instance,
podcasting una. At the very

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.069
beginning, we talk about, well,
one, what is it that we're going

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.969
to discuss? And then our opening
tagline is that we're giving you

00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:44.659
tips and strategies to launch,
grow and monetize your podcast.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.520
So if you're a podcaster that
speaks directly to you because

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.189
you're listening to this, or
you're watching this because

00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:54.590
you're looking for those tips and
you want to think through, for

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:58.189
your podcast in a similar way,
what is it that people are

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.389
looking for? And then how do you
make sure that you address that

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.180
in your intro? So they're going
to continue to listen, not just

00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:08.139
to the one episode, but to every
single episode, it'll actually

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.590
turn into a subscriber that then
goes on to download everything

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.930
that you have. And then the third
thing that you want to make sure

00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:18.370
you mentioned in your podcast
intro is why someone should care.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.479
Why should anyone care that your
podcast exists? Are they going to

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.060
lose weight? Are they going to be
happier? Are the relationships

00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:27.610
going to get better? Are they
going to make money, save money?

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.289
What is it that you were offering
to them? What is the end result

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.870
look like for them, if they not
only listened to your podcast,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.939
but then also put it into
practice.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.509
Gilon: So is there an ideal
podcast length, short answer?

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.979
Nope. Joe Rogan has some episodes
that are three hours long, but

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.800
then there are other podcasts
that do just fine and are very

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.310
successful at 10 minutes or less.
The reality is we love podcasts

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.400
because of the content that
they're presenting. And so if it

00:03:56.401 --> 00:04:00.000
takes you 10 minutes to get out
great glorious content, amazing.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.960
If you have some podcast episodes
that are on the longer end, maybe

00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:07.590
up to three hours, that's okay.
Too. People come to the podcast

00:04:07.591 --> 00:04:11.310
to get the content, to get what
you say weekly. And to be honest,

00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:13.379
there are times when we need just
a quick little something to

00:04:13.381 --> 00:04:15.599
listen to. And there are times
when we have a lot of space in

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.300
our day to listen to something.
It really just depends on what

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.579
you're trying to accomplish and
what you're trying to get across.

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:26.939
Travis: Be a guest on other
people's podcasts, but not just

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:31.319
anyone's podcast podcasts that
have a similar target audience

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:34.949
that you do. So let's say for
example, that you talk about

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:38.790
online marketing. For instance,
you want to find other podcasts

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.800
in your space where they talk
about online marketing, where

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.589
they talk about how to grow your
business, where they talk about

00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:47.519
the entrepreneur life. Because
those are the groups of people

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.180
that have already self selected
and said, Hey, I want to hear

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.750
this kind of podcast content. If
you can pitch yourself as a guest

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.430
to be on those podcasts, then
they will immediately trust you

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:02.639
because they already trust the
podcast host of the podcast

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.819
you're guesting on because they
listen to it every week. And then

00:05:05.821 --> 00:05:08.519
when you're able to demonstrate
your expertise and say at the end

00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:11.759
of the episode, Hey, by the way,
I also have a podcast where I

00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:15.149
talk about X, Y, and Z. You're
going to get a good number of

00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:19.500
people from that podcast to come
over and subscribe to yours.

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.240
Gilon: Interviewing noteworthy
guests that have a significant

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.000
audience is actually one of our
favorite marketing strategies for

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.470
podcasters. The only thing is the
guest has to promote the episode.

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:33.959
Ideally, you want to make it as
easy as possible for them to

00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:37.050
promote the episode. So some
things that you can do are

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.319
creating an audio gram or a
social media graphic for

00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:43.290
Facebook, for Instagram, whatever
social media platform you promote

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.350
on. That's a really easy way to
get them to share that episode

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.779
when you have that created and
it's made right there for them

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:51.480
and you give it to them. The
second thing that you can do is

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.389
create a blurb for them to
include in their newsletter about

00:05:54.391 --> 00:05:57.740
the episode. Hey, this is an
episode about X, Y, and you send

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.930
that over to them. They can push
that right out to their people

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:03.290
via email. The other thing that
you can do is provide a direct

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.620
link where people can listen to
the episode. The idea is that it

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.920
should be as easy as copying and
pasting and pushing out to their

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.040
people. You want to have no
reason for them not to share the

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.029
episode and promote it.

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:21.310
Travis: Use templates, make it
your goal in life as a podcaster,

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:26.110
to never duplicate your work,
whether it's your outlines,

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.079
whether it's your audio editing
software, your projects that you

00:06:29.081 --> 00:06:32.920
work in, your emails that you
send to your guests, anything

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.000
that you do consistently spend
some time really make it

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.329
unbreakable, make sure that it's
exactly the way that you want it.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.620
And then don't go back and redo
that actually leverage that work

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.759
you've done in the past to speed
up future episodes. So let's say

00:06:48.761 --> 00:06:51.069
for instance, that you have a
guest that you're bringing onto

00:06:51.071 --> 00:06:54.970
your show, rather than writing a
custom email from scratch, send

00:06:54.971 --> 00:06:57.939
them the one that you sent to
your previous guest, but then

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.279
change out the first name to
them. It looks like a brand new

00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:03.550
email because they haven't seen
that email before. And you know

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.250
that it has all the details that
they need to know to make sure

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.879
they're fully prepared to come on
your episode. Once you finish

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.250
your recording and you bring your
interview into your audio editing

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.009
software, you shouldn't be
creating a new project from

00:07:15.011 --> 00:07:19.360
scratch. You should be opening up
a previous episode, saving it as

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.470
a duplicate and then rewriting
over the pieces that need to

00:07:23.471 --> 00:07:26.319
change leaving, intact , your
intro, your outro, and all of

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:30.189
your audio preferences. And then
when you're creating your show

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.819
notes, they should be copy and
paste from your previous episode,

00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:36.370
show notes, and then filling out
the fields and changing

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.189
everything. That's different just
by using templates, just by

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.060
leveraging your previous work.
And previous efforts for future

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:49.089
episodes is going to save you a
ton of time. These show notes is

00:07:49.091 --> 00:07:52.899
the section of your podcast
episode that allows you to engage

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:55.480
for your listeners, provide some
next steps for those that are

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.180
ready to take action on what they
just listened to. And also

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.500
persuade someone new to listen to
the episode. The number one best

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.269
practice is to use formatting.
All right , a majority of podcast

00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:11.769
players like Apple podcasts,
Google podcasts , uh , overcast,

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:15.490
they support HTML formatting.
That means you could put

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.449
paragraph breaks, bullet points
in bed links, all the stuff that

00:08:19.451 --> 00:08:23.680
you need to do to make your show
notes look nice because when your

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.350
show notes are properly
formatted, when it's easy to

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:30.220
navigate within your episode
description, it makes it easier

00:08:30.221 --> 00:08:32.769
for your listeners to find what
they're looking for. Right?

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.139
Instead of combing through
several paragraphs of

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.840
information, they can just zip
down to the list of links that

00:08:37.841 --> 00:08:41.080
you mentioned and click on the
one that they're looking for.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.169
Because remember when someone
goes to your show notes, your

00:08:44.171 --> 00:08:47.470
episode description, they're
going for a number of reasons.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.129
First reason they heard you
mentioned something in the

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.590
podcast and they want to find the
link. They want to learn more.

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:57.120
They want to buy that product,
that you, they are looking for a

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.730
particular piece of information.
And they're going to take action

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.190
on that. The other reason
somebody goes through your show

00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:05.519
notes or your episode description
is they're not sure that they

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.120
want to devote the 30 minutes, 40
minutes hour to listening to the

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.539
full episode. And so they see the
title is interesting. They're

00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:15.960
curious. They want to learn more
and they go to your show notes

00:09:16.549 --> 00:09:19.169
too , to see some amplifying
information to see is this

00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:20.519
something that I really want to
listen to?

00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:26.570
Sarah: So let's talk about
whether you actually need a

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.059
custom podcast website now for
most pod-casters the answer is

00:09:32.061 --> 00:09:36.950
actually no, because if your
podcast has an RSS feed with a

00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:42.799
podcast host like Buzzsprout
chances are you already have a

00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:46.879
podcast website with Buzzsprouts
website, you get a homepage with

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.690
links to obviously all of your
episodes that your listeners can

00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:54.440
listen to. You can also direct
them to different podcast

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.350
directories like Apple podcast,
Stitcher and Spotify. If they

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:01.429
want to go listen and subscribe
there, and you can also use your

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.330
own domain names . So you can
look and feel like your own

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.960
podcast website . You're just
looking for a place for people to

00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:12.110
listen to your episodes. Changes
are you don't need to spend that

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.690
money to build your own custom
website.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.820
Gilon: You may think that the
best strategy is to put your

00:10:19.821 --> 00:10:23.450
entire episode up on a social
media platform, but actually you

00:10:23.451 --> 00:10:26.389
want to create teaser content and
teaser content gives them a

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.580
little sound bite , just a little
snippet that what's their

00:10:28.581 --> 00:10:31.730
appetites want to go listen to
the rest of the episode, wherever

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.269
they listen on Apple podcasts or
Spotify, or what have you. So

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.940
we're going to talk about what
three things are included in

00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:40.970
every good social media post. The
first thing that you need is a

00:10:40.971 --> 00:10:44.000
visual element, right? So people
are scrolling. They're reading,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.120
whatever. If you post a picture
that causes them to stop. And the

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.580
idea is that they stop , they
listen, they read, they engage.

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:52.279
And the picture of visual element
helps them do that. So this can

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.830
be a graphic. It could be a
headshot of your guest . It could

00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:57.259
be an audio gram . The second
thing that you need is a good

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.100
hook. Think about what can I say
to make someone want to continue

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.370
listening, to go check out the
full episode. It could be a crazy

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.799
stat. It could be a really good
quote. It could be a couple of

00:11:06.801 --> 00:11:09.860
bullet points that summarize the
high points of the episode.

00:11:10.129 --> 00:11:13.519
Whatever that thing is, put that
in the caption to help encourage

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.580
people to go check out the full
episode and finally a link you

00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:20.299
want to include a direct link to
that specific podcast episode in

00:11:20.301 --> 00:11:23.539
your post. If you nail all three
of these elements, you'll not

00:11:23.541 --> 00:11:27.049
only intrigue new listeners.
You'll also encourage existing

00:11:27.051 --> 00:11:28.850
subscribers to share your posts
as well,

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.809
Travis: Batch production of your
podcast episodes. So anytime that

00:11:35.811 --> 00:11:38.809
you were producing an episode,
there's so much involved. There's

00:11:38.811 --> 00:11:43.129
so many moving pieces that need
to happen in a specific order in

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.860
order for you to create that
episode. So you have to start

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.230
with generating ideas. Then you
have to create outlines or

00:11:48.409 --> 00:11:50.629
scripts. If you have a scripted
podcast, you have to line up

00:11:50.659 --> 00:11:53.470
interviews, you need to record
the episode. You need to edit it.

00:11:53.471 --> 00:11:55.940
You need to upload it. You need
to schedule it. All of those

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.690
things take time. What takes even
more time If you do every single

00:12:00.691 --> 00:12:04.200
episode by itself. But let's say
instead that you scheduled all

00:12:04.201 --> 00:12:07.259
the interviews that you needed
for the entire month in one week,

00:12:07.289 --> 00:12:09.899
maybe you had to record it on
Tuesday. And to record it on

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.570
Thursday, you know , have four
episodes to start working with

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.169
that Saturday. You create the
outlines for the rest of the

00:12:16.171 --> 00:12:18.809
episode. You record the
narration, put it with your intro

00:12:18.811 --> 00:12:21.659
and your outro music, and you
export it. You output it to your

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.570
podcast host, and now you
schedule it out. You've just done

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.759
a month of content in one week.
So if you're looking to optimize

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.669
and streamline your workflow even
more beyond templates, the next

00:12:32.671 --> 00:12:34.769
best thing to do is to batch your
episodes.

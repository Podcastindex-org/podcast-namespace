## Abstract

Using Value 4 Value apps, listeners can send sats to the hosts of the podcasts they listen to. Per minute sending is
called `stream` and manual payments are called `boost`s. If there is a message to the podcaster, with a boost, it is
called a `boostagram`.
These apps (see [Reference Implementations](#reference-implementations)) adopted bLIP 10 with the **7629169** TLV type
for inputting key-value JSON metadata about the sent payment. The TLV holds data about the timestamp when the payment
was sent within the episode, the name of the podcast and
its [Guid](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/docs/1.0.md#guid), among other fields
described in the [Specification](#specification) section.

Example:

```json
{
  "podcast": "PODCASTNAME",
  "feedID": 1337,
  "episode": "EPISODENAME",
  "action": "boost",
  "ts": 33
}
```

## Specification

The sender of the payments (the podcast app) needs to input some metadata so the podcast host can identify whom the
payment is for. Most fields are optional.

### Formatting and encoding

A flat key-value json structure is used where the keys listed below can be set. The json string is then encoded
into `utf8` and attached to the keysend payment. Receivers of messages must be aware that there is no guarantee for the
order of the keys.

Sample JSON string, containing a selection of keys:

```json
{
  "app_name": "Castamatic",
  "app_version": "8.0.6",
  "value_msat_total": 49960,
  "url": "https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/1844352.rss",
  "podcast": "Mere Mortals",
  "action": "stream",
  "episode": "The Art Of NFT's & Aimless Wandering",
  "episode_guid": "Buzzsprout-9931017",
  "value_msat": 97940,
  "ts": 574,
  "name": "Podcaster",
  "sender_name": "Peter"
}
```

Treated as `utf8`, the hex value of this json record would be:
`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`

If a field is indicated to be a `str` in the fields-list, that means it is a JSON string (within quotes) and `int`s are
plain numbers.

### Fields

Identifying the podcast **required**: use any of `podcast`, `guid`, `feedID` and/or `url`. **guid preferred**

* `podcast` (str) Title of the podcast
* `feedID` (int) ID of podcast in PodcastIndex.org
* `url` (str) RSS feed URL of podcast
* `guid` (
  str) [The `<podcast:guid>` tag](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/docs/1.0.md#guid).

Identifying the episode **recommended**: use any of `episode`, `itemID` and/or `episode_guid`. **episode_guid
preferred**

* `episode` (str) Episode of the podcast
* `itemID` (int) ID of episode in PodcastIndex.org
* `episode_guid` (str) The GUID of the episode

Information about time within the episode **recommended**: use any of `ts`, `time`. **ts preferred**

* `ts` (int) Timestamp when the boost/stream was sent WITHIN the episode, in seconds (playback position)
* `time` (str) HH:MM:SS timestamp when the boost/stream was sent WITHIN the episode (playback position)

Rest of keys:

* `action` **recommended**: (str) "boost", "stream" or "auto"
* `app_name`: **recommended** (str) Name of sending app
* `app_version`: (str) Version of sending app
* `boost_link`: (str) App specific URL containing route to podcast, episode, and/or timestamp at time of the action
* `message` (str) Text message to add to the boost message: a boostagram
* `name` (str) Name for this split in value tag
* `sender_name` **recommended** (str) Name of sender (free text, not checked by signatures)
* `sender_id` (str) Static random identifier for users, not displayed by apps to prevent abuse. Apps can set this
  per-feed or app-wide. A GUID-like random identifier or a hash works well. Max 32 ascii characters.
* `speed` (str) Speed in which the podcast was played, in decimal. So 0.5 is half speed and 2 is double speed.
* `uuid` (str) Unique UUID of the payment
* `value_msat_total`: **recommended** (int) TOTAL Number of millisats for the payment (all splits together, before fees.
  The actual number someone entered in their player, for numerology purposes.)

## Examples & App Specifics

  "name": "Alby Test User PUT",
  "podcast": "Test Podcast Anchor",
  "feedID": 6015671,

  "sender_id": "nSiq7id78JAdH9uY1pIy",
  "sender_name": "@alwin_conshax",
  "message": "test",
  "itemID": "14934154309",
  "boost_link": "https://fountain.fm/episode/14934154309",
  "episode": "this is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very long episode name!!!",
  "ts": 15,
  "time": "00:00:15"
}
```

#### Stream

```json
{
  "app_name": "Fountain",
  "value_msat_total": 50000,
  "name": "Alby Test User PUT",
  "podcast": "Test Podcast Anchor",
  "feedID": 6015671,
  "action": "stream",
  "sender_id": "pqwMfFdkCwtj8LKm0tNu",
  "sender_name": "@moritz_conshax",
  "message": null,
  "itemID": "14934154309",
  "boost_link": "https://fountain.fm/episode/14934154309",
  "episode": "this is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very long episode name!!!",
  "ts": 62,
  "time": "00:01:02"
}
```

### Breez

Breez sends the guid on the itemID field and the sender_name is an empty string on streams.
Besides that Breez takes its fee from the total instead on top of the total as fountain does, this results in the
received value of a split being less than it should calculated from the total.

#### Boost

```json
{
  "podcast": "Test Podcast Anchor",
  "episode": "this is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very long episode name!!!",
  "action": "boost",
  "time": "00:00:24",
  "feedID": 6015671,
  "itemID": "12b4df54-af38-4c53-8099-82f9caacdcd5",
  "app_name": "Breez",
  "value_msat_total": 100000,
  "sender_name": "Jade Monkey",
  "message": "test"
}

```

#### Stream

```json
{
  "podcast": "Test Podcast Anchor",
  "episode": "this is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very long episode name!!!",
  "action": "stream",
  "time": "00:02:37",
  "feedID": 6015671,
  "itemID": "12b4df54-af38-4c53-8099-82f9caacdcd5",
  "app_name": "Breez",
  "value_msat_total": 100000,
  "sender_name": ""
}
```

# The "podcast:verify" Specification

<small>Version 1.0 by [@pofmagicfingers](https://github.com/pofmagicfingers) - 2022.08.03</small>

<br>

# Purpose

"Claiming" a podcast in a podcast directory, platform, app or service means that your customer is proving that
they are the owner of the podcast feed and have current control of it. You might claim a podcast in Apple to add to your
iTunes Connect account, Podchaser to add host information, in GoodPods to be notified of comments, in
Podcasterwallet.com to add value4value info, or in Spotify to add it to the Spotify dashboard for analytics.

The "quick-claim" process described in this document, is a programmatic way to claim a podcast, by taking a podcast  
owner from the claiming service to an authenticated page on their podcast host to prove ownership.

To enable the quick claiming of a podcast, we propose a new `<podcast:verify>` tag to hold the relevant URI's and key
material.

<br>

# The Claiming Service

Run a podcast directory, app, platform or service and want to check that someone is the owner of this podcast?

Benefits of using "quick-claim" are that it's one-click within a browser or webview, rather than sending a potential
user an email. Assuming they are logged-in to their podcast host (or can log in), they can approve your request
instantly and come back to your service within seconds.

Additional benefits are:

- Anyone authorized to access the podcast host dashboard can claim the show (subject to the user having the right
  permissions).
- Email confirmations are often subject to delay, fall into spam, or are blocked altogether.
- Email confirmation emails can be faked and lead to security concerns.
- The listing of an email address in an RSS feed leads to privacy issues and spam.
- Email confirmations often lead to around [25%](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-typical-abandonment-rate-for-email-verifications) abandomnent

<br>

## 1. Check that quick-claiming is enabled in the RSS feed

```xml
<podcast:verify
  auth="https://hostingprovider.com/claiming/"
  pub="MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEEVs/o5+uQbTjL3chynL4wXgUg2R9q9UU8I5mEovUf86QZ7kOBIjJwqnzD1omageEHWwHdBO6B+dFabmdT9POxg=="
/>
```

The presence of the `<podcast:verify>` tag means that this feed supports quick claiming. The tag will have two required
attributes that must be present:

- `auth` (required): The https URL of a "quick claim" page on the hosting provider that is protected by customer login.
- `pub` (required): The public key corresponding to the private key the hosting provider users to sign claiming requests.

<br>

## 2. Give the podcaster a "Quick Claim" button

You will redirect your user to the `auth` url present in the podcaster's RSS feed, with 1 to 3 URL parameters, as
defined below.

### Param: `consumer`

Your directory/service base URL of the return_path.

It's recommanded to support open graph allowing the hosting provider to present a clean name and icon for your
service while asking permission. If open graph is not supported, hosting provider will most likely fallback to
hostname, path, favicon.

Splitting the return url into a `consumer` and a `return_path` gives us control of which part of the url is used
for open graph data while ensuring the return path is tied to the hostname and identity presented to the user.

#### Examples:

`consumer=https://podcastindex.org` â¤µ

```html
PodcastIndex.org (podcastindex.org) The Podcast Index is here to preserve,
protect and extend the open, independent podcasting ecosystem. This service
would like to verify you are the owner of this podcast. Do you want us to
confirm ?
```

`consumer=https://podcastindex.org/quick_claim` â¤µ

```html
ðŸ—¼PodcastIndex Quick Claiming (podcastindex.org) Claiming your podcast into The
Podcast Index directory gives you cool stuff ! This service would like to verify
you are the owner of this podcast. Do you want us to confirm ?
```

<br>

### Param: `return_path`

A path relative to the `consumer` parameter, to redirect with the result of the authentication. If the consumer is enough,
you can omit it.

#### Examples:

These are example calculations of what the return url will be with different inputs:

`consumer=https://podcastindex.org/quick_claim` (no return path) â¤µ <br>

```http
https://podcastindex.org/quick_claim?token=[token]
```

`consumer=https://podcastindex.org/quick_claim&return_path=/claimed.php` â¤µ <br>

```http
https://podcastindex.org/quick_claim/claimed.php?token=[token]
```

`consumer=https://podcastindex.org/quick_claim&return_path=../claim.php` â¤µ <br>

```http
https://podcastindex.org/claim.php?token=[token]
```

<br>

### Param: `guid`

If a [`<podcast:guid>`](/docs/tags/guid.md) is present in the RSS feed it SHOULD be included. If it's not we omit it or send an empty string.

We keep it simple, we should trust the users of our spec (in this case the hosting providers) : if they don't include
a [`<podcast:guid>`](/docs/tags/guid.md), I don't see the point to calculate it and give it to them, as they most likely don't have it on their
hand and probably don't use it. If they would, it would be included in the feed.

If we don't have any [`<podcast:guid>`](/docs/tags/guid.md), maybe the hosting provider has only partial support of the podcasting 2.0 spec. Maybe
they only support claiming and include the guid in the auth url. Perhaps it's a Wordpress extension and there is only
one podcast and no need to "select a podcast" when you're logged in. We can't know and guess all usages.

<br>

### PHP Example

Here's a simple example, in PHP, of a quick claim button:

```php
<a
 class="btn btn-default"
 href="<?php echo $feed_auth_url."?consumer=https://myservice.com/quick_claim&guid=".$feed_guid; ?>"
>
Claim this now
</a>
```

<br>

## 3. Handle the response from the hosting provider

If the podcaster wants to claim this podcast, they will confirm it inside their hosting service. You will receive a GET
request to the `return URL` computed from the `consumer` and `return_path`.

The GET request will contain only one parameter: `token`.

This parameter will be a JSON Web Token ([JWT](https://jwt.io/)), and will include the following data :

```typescript
type QuickClaimResponse =
  | {
      guid?: GUID
      accepted: true
    }
  | {
      guid?: GUID
      accepted: false
      failureReason: "back" | string
    }
```

Using JWT lets us ensure the hosting provider wrote the response. It also allow us to define, or not, an expiration
date and such. ([More info on JWT](https://jwt.io/))

The JWT must use an asymmetric signing algorithm (ES256 for example). The response is signed by the hosting provider
private key, and it can be verified using the `pub` attribute of the tag (put there by the same hosting provider).

You can verify the signature in PHP with a JWT library. If it fails to decode, it means the signature is wrong or the
token has expired:

```php
$result = JWT::decode($quickClaimResponse, $feed["podcast:verify"]["pub"]);
```

As a podcast directory, app, platform or service you now have the confirmation the user was indeed authenticated,
confirmed the operation, and that it's the same entity giving you this information and producing the RSS feed.

<br><br>

# The Hosting Service

Quick-claim is designed to allow your customers to demonstrate that they own their podcast on third-party services.

The benefits of using quick claiming are that it's one-click for your customers from the service they wish to claim,
direct to you. You can monitor the services your users are using, and can give multiple people access to claiming a
podcast on a separate service based on your service's access levels.

The email in your customer's RSS feed need not be the registration email of the user on this third-party service, thus
lowering your customer support calls and streamlining access for your customers. Ease of use on third-party services
retains the customer with your company, thus lowering churn, and possibly giving them more access and interaction,
prolonging their activity with you.

If you're a podcast host wanting to add quick claiming for your customers, then here's how you can do it painlessly:

<br>

## 1. Add the `<podcast:verify>` tag to your RSS feeds

```xml
<podcast:verify
  auth="https://amazingpodcasthost.example.com/claiming"
  pub="MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEEVs/o5+uQbTjL3chynL4wXgUg2R9q9UU8I5mEovUf86QZ7kOBIjJwqnzD1omageEHWwHdBO6B+dFabmdT9POxg=="
/>
```

The tag needs two attributes :

- `auth` (required): The URL of a secure page that is protected on your server by customer login.
- `pub` (required): The public key corresponding to the private key you use to sign claiming requests.

<br>

## 2. Host a page for your customer to agree to "claim" a podcast

Your claiming `auth` url will be called with 1 to 3 parameters, as defined below:

### Param: `consumer`

The directory/service base URL.

This url must be used to present the permission asker to the user. It's recommended for services to support
open graph on this URL allowing the hosting provider to present a clean name and icon. If open graph is not supported,
you will most likely fallback to title and favicon, hostname only, or full url.

Splitting the return url into a `consumer` and a `return_path` gives us control of which part of the url is used for
open graph data while ensuring the return path is tied to the hostname and identity presented to the user.

<br>

### Param: `return_path`

A path relative to the `consumer` parameter, to use as a callback to the `consumer` with the result of the authentication.
If the `consumer` is enough, you can omit this parameter.

These are example calculations of what the return url will be with different inputs:

#### Examples:

`consumer=https://podcastindex.org/quick_claim` (no return path) â¤µ <br>

```http
https://podcastindex.org/quick_claim?token=[token]
```

`consumer=https://podcastindex.org/quick_claim&return_path=/claimed.php` â¤µ <br>

```http
https://podcastindex.org/quick_claim/claimed.php?token=[token]
```

`consumer=https://podcastindex.org/quick_claim&return_path=../claim.php` â¤µ <br>

```http
https://podcastindex.org/claim.php?token=[token]
```

<br>

### Param: `guid`

If a `<podcast:guid>` tag was present in the RSS feed, expect it to also be included as a parameter here.

### PHP Example:

```php
<?php
$HOSTING_PRIVATE_KEY = "MIGHAgEAMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHBG0wawIBAQQgevZzL1gdAFr88hb2
OF/2NxApJCzGCEDdfSp6VQO30hyhRANCAAQRWz+jn65BtOMvdyHKcvjBeBSDZH2r
1RTwjmYSi9R/zpBnuQ4EiMnCqfMPWiZqB4QdbAd0E7oH50VpuZ1P087G";

if (!$user['loggedin']) {
   // this user is not logged in. Take them to log in
   // Retain the consumer, return_path, guid, and bring them back here
	//
	exit;
}

// You might want to give confirmation that the podcast they are claiming
// is the correct podcast.
// Grab the podcast details in an array from your local systems.
// Check that the podcast is owned by this person, of course.

$consumer = $params["consumer"];
$return_path = $params["return_path"];
$podcast = lookup_from_guid($params['guid']);

// If podcast is not found on this user we redirect with an error message:

if(!$podcast) {
	  header(
		    "Location: ".
		    $consumer.
		    $return_path.
		    "?token=".
		    build_jwt_token(
			      [
				      "accepted" => false,
				      "error" => "Podcast could not be found for this user"
			      ],
			      $HOSTING_PRIVATE_KEY
		    )
	  );
	  exit();
}

$guid = $podcast["guid"];


// If we already shown the page and got user response
//
// checking csrf depends on your context, but is a strong recommendation for security
if(check_csrf()) exit("Bad request");

$action = $params["action"];
if($action == "accept") {
	header(
		"Location: ".
		$consumer.
		$return_path.
		"?token=".
		build_jwt_token(
			[
				"accepted" => true
			],
			$HOSTING_PRIVATE_KEY
		)
	);
	exit();
} else if ($action == "back") {
	header(
		"Location: ".
		$consumer.
		$return_path.
		"?token=".
		build_jwt_token(
			[
				"accepted" => false,
				"error" => "back"
			],
			$HOSTING_PRIVATE_KEY
		)
	);
	exit();
}

$service = opengraph($consumer);

$claim_fields = <<<TAGS
<input type="hidden" name="guid" value="$guid" />
<input type="hidden" name="consumer" value="$consumer" />
<input type="hidden" name="return_path" value="$return_path />
TAGS;

?>
<h1>Claiming your podcast</h1>
<img src="<?= $service["icon"] ?>">
<h3>
	<?= $service["name"] ?>
	<small>(<?= parse_url($consumer,PHP_URL_HOST) ?>)</small>
</h3>
<p>This service wants us to confirm you have control over this podcast : <?= $podcast["name"]; ?></p>
<form method="post" action="/quick_claim">
<?= $claim_fields ?>
<?= put_csrf_protection() ?>
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="accept" />
<input type="submit" value="I do">
</form>
<form method="post" action="/quick_claim">
<?= $claim_fields ?>
<?= some_csrf_protection ?>
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="back" />
<input type="submit" value="cancel this request">
</form>
```

The above will successfully check that your user is authenticated and send back the JWT token to the directory service
if the user agreed.

<br><br>

## Full Workflow Example

This section will summarize everything into one big example. Here are the defined terms we will use in this example:

- **DIRECTORY**: a podcast directory platform
- **HOST**: a podcast hosting service
- **PODCAST** is a show with an RSS feed
- **CREATOR** is an owner of the **PODCAST** who is allowed to claim it

<br>

**HOST** adds these elements to the RSS feed:

```xml
<podcast:guid>ead4c236-bf58-58c6-a2c6-a6b28d128cb6</podcast:guid>
<podcast:verify
  auth="https://host.com/studio/quick_claim/"
  pub="MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEEVs/o5+uQbTjL3chynL4wXgUg2R9q9UU8I5mEovUf86QZ7kOBIjJwqnzD1omageEHWwHdBO6B+dFabmdT9POxg=="
/>
```

**DIRECTORY** presents a button labeled "Quick Claim" on the page of every **PODCAST**.

When **CREATOR** clicks on the "Quick Claim" button on the page belonging to their **PODCAST**, they are redirected
to their **HOST** with this URL:

```http
https://host.com/studio/quick_claim/?guid=ead4c236-bf58-58c6-a2c6-a6b28d128cb6&consumer=https://directory.com/quick_claiming/ead4c236-bf58-58c6-a2c6-a6b28d128cb6&return_path=/return
```

**HOST** can use the `consumer` parameter to fetch some data (name, icon, description) through open graph. In this
example **DIRECTORY** uses the `consumer` URL, including podcast guid, and could use it to add some podcast info into the
open graph description.

**HOST** asks for **CREATOR** confirmation in a logged-in only area after verifying, on their own responsibility, if
this user account indeed has access to this podcast.

When **CREATOR** agrees to the claim request, the **HOST** will generate a JWT token, signed by their private key,
authenticating the **CREATOR** decision.

#### Unsigned JWT:

```json
{
  "guid": "ead4c236-bf58-58c6-a2c6-a6b28d128cb6",
  "accepted": true
}
```

#### Signed JWT:

```base64
eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJndWlkIjoiZWFkNGMyMzYtYmY1OC01OGM2LWEyYzYtYTZiMjhkMTI4Y2I2IiwiYWNjZXB0ZWQiOnRydWV9.eOXYFi9uUSUAKWcI8GdJ15RIhjoCvR0l9TUCPsqhsTYqaGFTwbH6zXzYqIqhxmtSotvL8ZLumP64LRFBjHX5Mw
```

Decode/Encode online with : https://jwt.io/

#### Key Details

```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

<br><br>

**CREATOR** are redirected to the **DIRECTORY** with this URL:

```http
https://directory.com/quick_claiming/ead4c236-bf58-58c6-a2c6-a6b28d128cb6/return?token=eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJndWlkIjoiZWFkNGMyMzYtYmY1OC01OGM2LWEyYzYtYTZiMjhkMTI4Y2I2IiwiYWNjZXB0ZWQiOnRydWV9.eOXYFi9uUSUAKWcI8GdJ15RIhjoCvR0l9TUCPsqhsTYqaGFTwbH6zXzYqIqhxmtSotvL8ZLumP64LRFBjHX5Mw
```

**DIRECTORY** can now check the token parameter to ensure it has been correctly signed with the private key
corresponding to the public key seen in the RSS feed, and in this case, the claiming request has been accepted.

Other responses could be, for example:

```http
https://directory.com/quick_claiming/ead4c236-bf58-58c6-a2c6-a6b28d128cb6/return?token=eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJndWlkIjoiZWFkNGMyMzYtYmY1OC01OGM2LWEyYzYtYTZiMjhkMTI4Y2I2IiwiYWNjZXB0ZWQiOmZhbHNlLCJlcnJvciI6IlVzZXIgY2FuJ3QgYWNjZXNzIHRvIHRoaXMgc2hvdyJ9.MDkZanxlukjQRAj5zd2GoWetAwMWPZs1RU24HdSw8LJm3Z73kL2U4gHMOJUg62LtZdIoH3tktSR0w-1Ltuo4Ig
```

```json
{
  "guid": "ead4c236-bf58-58c6-a2c6-a6b28d128cb6",
  "accepted": false,
  "error": "User can't access to this show"
}
```

```http
https://directory.com/quick_claiming/ead4c236-bf58-58c6-a2c6-a6b28d128cb6/return?token=eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJndWlkIjoiZWFkNGMyMzYtYmY1OC01OGM2LWEyYzYtYTZiMjhkMTI4Y2I2IiwiYWNjZXB0ZWQiOmZhbHNlLCJlcnJvciI6ImJhY2sifQ.TP8h8Hwh7oRpcuTPXOeqrO46sNwlwC4RLdyMtdFqZQfsS0pUT71_ljoUWq3a0o_hUjuVvPoWnDXar7o2BbLw6w
```

...or...

```json
{
  "guid": "ead4c236-bf58-58c6-a2c6-a6b28d128cb6",
  "accepted": false,
  "error": "back"
}
```

<br><br>

## Final Thoughts

Here are my thoughts on this idea and how to implement it, feel free to make any remarks about it.

JWT seems to me to be the middle ground between complexity and simplicity for a decentralized authorization system.
It only requires the hosting provider to add a private key somewhere and print the pub key on the feed.
Signing/Verifying JWT is quick and easy and there are libraries in almost any languages. It basically falls down
to something like `[verify|sign]JWT(content, priv/pub_key)` in most languages.

Open Graph is a nice bonus "out of the box" for permission asker identity.

We could also make this a kind of API spec, and add more data to the token.
Maybe mimick oauth and add a scope param asking specifically for some data, permissions about the
feed. (`scope="stats,edit,delete,admin"` etc)

That's a big subject and a spec of its own. That could be a nice addition, but it has to be done in a way we can trust
the system and all information it conveys.
